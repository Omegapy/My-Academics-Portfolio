Assignment Directions:  

Option #1: Hullabaloo Party Supplies Customer Order System
For this project you will go through the development and analysis process for a fictional company: Hullabaloo Party Supplies (HPS).

Hullabaloo Party Supplies (HPS) is a party supply provider and distributor with thirteen nationwide locations. Historically, the company has sold its supplies to third-party vendors for resale. The organization has recently decided to change its business practice, however, ending sales of its goods to those vendors. Instead, it is moving to a system that will allow consumers to order supplies directly from HPS, which will then ship directly to those consumers.

HPS management reviewed the system they have in place for vendor orders and have decided that they will not be able to leverage the existing system for the move to direct consumer ordering. As such they have hired you, a Systems Analyst, to help them design a new customer ordering system.

Management has met to determine the basic requirements for the system. The customers will visit an HPS online store, and will be presented with a shopping experience in which they can add items to a virtual shopping cart. When finished shopping, the customers will check out, at which time they will supply their information, indicate if they would like to create an account, choose their shipping option, and pay the bill.

The system will need to:

- Allow the customer to order online; the customer must be able to order multiple different items, as well as choose different quantities
- Obtain complete customer information
- Allow the customer to create an account
- Calculate order cost including tax
- Offer payment via credit card or PayPal
- Debit the ordered items from inventory
- Offer multiple choices for shipping.
- (Note: Once an order is complete the process will transition to the shipping system. Shipping system design is not part of option 1).

Your Portfolio Project will be completed in phases. For the final deliverable you will combine all of your work into one professional document you would be pleased with presenting to executives of the company.
