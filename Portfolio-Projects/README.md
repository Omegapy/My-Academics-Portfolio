This is my Portfolio Project for my CSC475 – Platform-Based Development Android Course. It was developed in four stages, Modules 2, 4, 6, 8. The project can be of your choice.

This is my choice:

Recipe app: An app that provides a collection of recipes with search and favorite features.

The project should be completed in four parts, following agile methodology:

- Module 2 (Module-2 Milesone.pdf) Requirements Gathering and Analysis: A document that outlines the purpose and scope of the app. Identifying the target audience and their needs. Lists the key features and functionalities of the app. Analyze any specific UI/UX requirements.
- Module 4 (Module-4-Milestone.pdf) design: A document that provides the design details for the app. This includes the architecture, components, and overall layout of the user interface. Include wireframes or mockups to illustrate the app's design.
- Module 6 (Module-6-Milestone.pdf)Implementation and Source Details: The actual implementation of the app, along with source code details (not available here), including screenshots to showcase the app's functionality and appearance. Explains the challenges faced during implementation and how they were overcome.
- Module 8 (Module-8-Portfolio-Project.pdf and the app directory) Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance: The final document covers the testing process, including any unit tests or UI tests conducted. Explains the deployment process and any challenges encountered during app deployment. Discusses strategies for ongoing maintenance, bug fixes, and future enhancements.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Program Description:

The project contains the document (Module-8-Porfolio-Project.pdf) for my portfolio project module 8. It is the last step in developing my Android “My Recipe App.” This essay contains a description of the testing process, including details of unit tests and UI tests that were conducted. Additionally, it explains the deployment process of the app and addresses challenges encountered during the deployment phase. Finally, it discusses strategies for ongoing maintenance, bug fixes, and potential future enhancements for the app.

Title: Final Portfolio Project CSC470: Database Model  
Professor: Dr. Vanessa Cooper
Winter B Semester (24WB) – 2025  
Student: Alexander (Alex) Ricciardi  
Date: 02/09/2025   

Grade: 100% A

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Assignment Direction:    

Option #1: Database Model Draft  
Note: The Portfolio Project, Option #1, consists of three parts. This Milestone will be a draft of the database model. You will incorporate instructor feedback before submitting it with the final Portfolio Project in Module 8.

Create a database model according to the following steps:

Option #1: Database Model  
The Portfolio Project, Option #1, consists of three parts. Please review all three and submit together for grading.
Note: Part 1 was completed as a draft in the Module 7 Portfolio Milestone, Option #1. Please make any updates necessary to that Milestone, being sure to incorporate instructor feedback.  

Part 1: Database Model  
Create a database model while following the steps listed below:  
- Create a simple class diagram containing three classes: Vehicle, Car, and Truck. Provide two attributes for each of these three classes.  
  - Create a rough sketch of a relational table that will store the objects belonging to the aforementioned three classes.  
  - Ensure you have tried all three options—single table, two tables, and three tables—in your database design.  
  -  Enter two objects per table, corresponding to the classes.  
- Use the two-table design to recreate a Car object.  
- Repeat the preceding step to recreate a Truck object.
- Create a simple association relationship in a separate class diagram showing Driver and Car.  
  - Apply a multiplicity of 1 on the driver side and N on the Car side.  
- Add/modify your table designs to handle storing of two objects belonging to Car and two belonging to Driver.
  - Modify the multiplicity on the Driver side to N. This makes it a many-to-many multiplicity.  
- Modify your table designs to handle this multiplicity and show where and how the KEYS or IDs will have to be placed.
- Create a class diagram corresponding to the tables you have designed. Stereotype all classes on that class diagram as <<table>>.  

Part 2: Pseudocode  
Using a programming language of your choice, write a script that will print out pseudocode of your model. Paste the pseudocode in a Word document.

Part 3: Lessons Learned Reflection  
Write a one- to two-page summary that outlines the lessons you have learned in this software engineering course. Reflect on how these lessons can be applied toward more effective software engineering practices and modeling.  
Compile all your work (Parts 1-3) into a single document and submit as a Word or PDF file.  

Your paper must be formatted according to the APA guidelines in the CSU Global Writing Center. The CSU Global Library and Writing Center links can be found in the course navigation panel. Review the Portfolio Project grading rubric for specific grading criteria.

Grade:  100% A

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements:  
- Java JDK-21  
- C++  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Assignment Directions:  

The assignment has two parts:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part-1:  

Requirements:  
- C++17

The Assignment Direction:    

Portfolio Project: Part 1  
For your Portfolio Project, you will demonstrate an understanding of the various concepts discussed in each module. For the first part of your Portfolio Project, you will create a C++ application that will exhibit concurrency concepts. Your application should create two threads that will act as counters. One thread should count up to 20. Once thread one reaches 20, then a second thread should be used to count down to 0. For your created code, provide a detailed analysis of appropriate concepts that could impact your application. Specifically, address:  
•	Performance issues with concurrency  
•	Vulnerabilities exhibited with use of strings  
•	Security of the data types exhibited.  
Compile and submit your pseudocode, source code, and screenshots of the application executing the application, the results and your GIT repository in a single document.  

To receive full credit for the packaging requirements for your Critical Thinking and Portfolio assignments you must:
1) Put your C++ source code in .cpp text files. Note that I execute all your programs to check them out.  
2) In a Word or PDF "documentation" file, labeled as such, put a copy of your C++ source code and execution output screen snapshots.  
3) Some positive evidence that you've definitely stored your source code in a GitHub repository on GitHub.com.  
4) Include a detailed analysis paper in APA Edition 7 format of the important concepts of concurrency with C++ to cover in detail performance issues, string vulnerabilities, and security of data types. Here's a link to the school's Writing Center where you can find the relevant APA Edition 7 requirements you need to follow -> https://csuglobal.libguides.com/writingcenterLinks to an external site.  
5) Put all your files into a single .zip file, and submit ONLY that .zip file for grading. Do not submit any additional separate files.  

Programs Descriptions:  

This program demonstrates the use of threads and how to synchronize them using mutexes and condition variables.  
Thread 1 counts up from 0 to a maximum count, while Thread 2 waits until Thread 1 completes, and then counts down from the maximum count to 0.  
  

⚠️ My notes:  
- The simple C++ console application is in file PF1-Thread Counting Synchronization.cpp  
- The program follows the following SEI CERT C/C++ Coding Standard:
	- CON50-CPP. Do not destroy a mutex while it is locked
	  CON51-CPP. Ensure actively held locks are released on exceptional conditions
	- CON52-CPP. Prevent data races when accessing bit-fields from multiple threads
	- CON54-CPP. Wrap functions that can spuriously wake up in a loop
	- CON55-CPP. Preserve thread safety and liveness when using condition variables
	- ERR50-CPP. Do not abruptly terminate the program
	- ERR51-CPP. Handle all exceptions
	- ERR55-CPP. Honor Exception Specifications
	- STR50-CPP. Guarantee that storage for strings has sufficient space
	- STR51-CPP. Do not attempt to create a std::string from a null pointer
	- STR52-CPP. Use valid references, pointers, and iterators t reference elements of a basic_string  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part-2:

Requirements:  
- Java Se 21  

Portfolio Project Part II 
Concurrency Concepts
For your Portfolio Project, you will demonstrate an understanding of the various concepts discussed in each module.  For the second part of your Portfolio Project, you will create a Java application that will exhibit concurrency concepts.  Your application should create two threads that will act as counters. One thread should count up to 20. Once thread one reaches 20, then a second thread should be used to count down to 0.  For your created code, please provide a detailed analysis of appropriate concepts that could impact your application.  Specifically, please address:  
•	Performance issues with concurrency  
•	Vulnerabilities exhibited with use of strings  
•	Security of the data types exhibited.  
Submit the following components to your GIT repository in a single   document:  
•	Word document with appropriate screenshots of your program executing, program analysis responses, and source code in the Word file.  
•	Submit your .java source code file(s).  If more than 1 file, submit a zip file.  
•	Provide a detailed comparison between the performance implementations between the Java and C++ versions of your applications.  Which implementation may be considered less vulnerable to security threats and why? Your detailed comparison should be 3-4 pages in length. Any citations should be formatted according to guidelines in the CSU Global Writing Center (located in the course navigation menu).  

To receive full credit for the packaging requirements for your Module 8 Portfolio Project assignment you must:  
1) Put your Java source code in .java text files. Note that I execute all your programs to check them out.  
2) In a Word or PDF "documentation and analysis" file, labeled as such, put a copy of your Java source code and execution output screen snapshots. This week this regular documentation file must also include a detailed analysis write-up of the important concepts of concurrency with Java to cover in detail performance issues, string vulnerabilities, and security of data types.  
3) Some positive evidence that you've definitely stored your source code in a GitHub repository on GitHub.com.  
4) Include a separate 3-4 page APA Edition 7 paper comparing the performance and security differences between C++ and Java multi-threaded programs. Here's the link to the school's Writing Center for APA Edition 7 requirements -> https://csuglobal.libguides.com/writingcenterLinks to an external site.  
5) Put all 4 of the above files into a single .zip file, and submit ONLY that .zip file for grading. Do not submit any additional separate files.  
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Programs Descriptions:  

This program demonstrates the use of threads and how to synchronize them using ReentrantLocks and Conditions.  
Thread 1 counts up from 0 to a maximum count, while Thread 2 waits until Thread 1 completes, and then counts down from the maximum count to 0.    

⚠️ My notes:  
- The simple Java console application is in the file ThreadCountingSynchronization.java
- The program follows the following SEI CERT Oracle Coding Standards for Java:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assignment Description:  

Create a Proposal for AI Implementation
For your Portfolio Project, you are a consultant for a prestigious firm. Your client is a growing insurance company looking to understand more about incorporating artificial intelligence into the business to help them provide better service and reduce overall costs.

Compose a proposal that analyzes whether this is a worthwhile investment for the company to make. Design this proposal to submit to your client's CEO and CIO.

You may need to make some assumptions regarding cost and leadership roles, but make them realistic. Think about the problem and how you propose solving it. Keep in mind AI is very new to this organization, so explain what AI is and what they gain to benefit from using it. Also, think about any risks they may face and address them by providing solutions to build trust in your ability to deliver. You should think through what type of data you will need to collect, and what you plan to do with it. Feel free to provide examples and diagrams which connect the concepts to their problems. Provide information on what it would take to scale AI across the organization. Identify what groups within the company, or processes within the business, could benefit from it the most.

Your paper should be 4-6 pages in length (excluding the cover page and references) and conform to the CSU Global Writing Center. Include at least five scholarly references in addition to the course textbook. The CSU Global Library is a good place to find these references. The CSU Global Library and Writing Center links can be found in the course navigation panel.

Portfolio Assignment Option 1: Person Class 
Program Name: Custom Queue ADT and Quicksort  
Fall B (24FB) – 2024  
Student: Alejandro (Alex) Ricciardi  
Date: 10/06/2024
   
Grade:  100% A

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Program Description:  
This program implements in Java a generic Linked-list queue and sorts the queue using a quicksort algorithm.  
The queue stores Person objects representing a person's first name, last name, and age.   
The Person objects in the queue can be sorted by last name or age.  

Quicksort algorithm notes:  
-	The quicksort algorithm implements a Hoare partition to partition the queue. Meaning that the head node of the linked-list queue is picked as the pivot.  
-	Additionally, a queue ADT sort is expected to be stable, preserving the relative (entry) order of elements with equal values.  
-	To partition a linked-list, the element needs to be traversed element by element. Dividing the list into three parts (left, equal, and right) helps simplify the recursion of traversing the list element by element and preserving elements with equal values in order of entry. This also avoids moving elements around in memory, as is required in array-based implementations of quicksort.  

       
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assignment Directions:  
Option #1: Person Class

Your Portfolio Project for CSC400 consists of the following:  
- Milestone 1 (due in Module 5): Java source code (with corrections if necessary) for programs created in Module 2 and Module 4.  
- Milestone 2 (due in Module 7): Java source code (with corrections if necessary) for programs created in Module 5 and Module 6.  
- Lessons Learned Reflection  
- Final Program  

Lessons Learned Reflection:  
Write a 2-page summary that outlines the lessons you have learned in this programming course. Reflect on how these lessons can be applied towards more effective coding.

Final Program:  
Write a program that creates a Person class that contains strings that represent the first and last name of a person and their age. You will need to create a Queue class that will store each person in the queue and can sort the queue based on last name or age.  

Prompt the user of the program to add five people to the queue. Your program should provide the contents of the queue and then sort the queue using the quick sort in two ways

1.	Descending order by last name  
2.	Descending order by age  

Assemble your Lessons Learned Reflection, your source code, and screenshots of the application executing and results into a single document. Submit your completed Portfolio Project by the posted due date.  

⚠️ My notes:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Program Description:  
The program manages a home inventory.  
It provides functionality for adding, removing, updating, and displaying home data.  
The program interacts with the user through a menu-driven interface and stores the home data in a file.   

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assignment Directions:  
Portfolio Project – Home Inventory Manager Option2  
Your Portfolio Project for CSC320 will consist of three components:  

•	Program corrections: Make the appropriate corrections to all the programming assignments submitted as Critical Thinking assignments from Modules 1-6. You will need to submit the programs along with the carefully outlined corrections needed in order for programs to run correctly.  
•	Lessons learned reflection: Create a 2-3-page summary that outlines the lessons learned in this Programming I course.  
•	Final program: Create a final program that meets the requirements outlined below.  

Final Program Requirements  
Create a home inventory class that will be used by a national builder to maintain an inventory of available houses in the country. The following attributes should be present in your home class:  

•	private int square_feet  
•	private string address  
•	private string city  
•	private string state  
•	private int zip_code  
•	private string Model_name  
•	private string sale_status (sold, available, or under contract)  

Your program should have appropriate methods such as:  

•	constructor  
•	add a new home  
•	remove a home  
•	update home attributes  
All methods should include try..catch constructs. Except as noted, all methods should return a success or failure message (failure message defined in "catch").  

1.	Create an additional class to call your home class (e.g., Main or HomeInventory). Include a try..catch construct and print it to the console.  
2.	Call home class with parameterized constructor (e.g., "square_feet, address, city, state, zip_code, Model_name, sale_status").  
o	Then, call the method to list the values. Loop through the array and print to the screen    
3.	Call the remove home method to clear the variables:  
o	Print the return value.  
4.	Add a new home.  
o	Print the return value.  
o	Call the list method and print the new home information to the screen.  
5.	Update the home (change the sale status).  
o	Print the return value.  
o	Call the listing method and print the information to the screen.  
6.	Display a message asking if the user wants to print the information to a file (Y or N).  
o	Use a scanner to capture the response. If "Y", print the file to a predefined location (e.g., C:\Temp\Home.txt). Note: you may want to create a method to print the information in the main class.  
o	If "N", indicate that a file will not be printed.  

Your final program submission materials must include your source code and screenshots of the application executing the application and the results.  
Compile your Module 1-6 programs with corrections, lessons learned reflection, and final program course code and application screenshots.  

⚠️ My notes:  
-	I got permission from Professor Pensado for the program to manipulate a file.  
-	The program utilizes BufferedReader and BufferedWriter classes to read and write a file, the program also uses the ArrayList class the access and modify the homes’ data.  
-	In the HomeInventory class the functionalities of methods getHomeByAddress, removeHomeByAddress, and updateHomeByAddress are not implemented in version 1 of the program. However, they are available for future versions of the program.  
-	The program handles exceptions by passing them from the Home class to the HomeInventory class, and then to the Main class, where the exceptions and errors are displayed to the user.  
-	For the source code please see Main.java, InputValidation. Java, Home.java, and HomeInventory.java files.

Portfolio Project (350 Points)
Argumentative Essay
For your Portfolio Project (due in Module 8) you will write an argumentative essay based on a topic in your major field of study.  
You will submit the topic for approval in Module 2, and continue to write and revise until the due date.  
If you critically read the assigned readings and lecture content, enthusiastically participate in the module discussions,  
submit your best work for the Critical Thinking assignments, and thoughtfully reflect on your instructor feedback,  
you will find that the work for your final portfolio project is the natural progression of your work during the course.  
Based on this cumulative approach, it should represent your strongest work.

Requirements  
Your essay must:

Be persuasive. You need to make a clear argument, articulated in your thesis statement, and supported throughout the body of the essay.  
Be directed at a specific audience.  
Have a thesis statement that includes your overall argument and maps out the points you make in the body of the paper.  
Support the thesis with research from credible sources.  
Demonstrate your ability to synthesize and analyze information from multiple sources in order to develop your own insights into the topic.  
Summarize and respond to counterarguments.  
Include proper in-text citations and references citations in APA format.  
Guidance
Length: 3-4 pages, not including the title page or references page, which you are required to include.
Support: 6 or more credible print sources cited in the paper and included on the references page.   
The sources should be from roughly the last five to seven years.  
Voice: Third-person. APA format does allow for limited use of first-person pronouns when describing your work,   
but it is unlikely you will need to use the first person in this project.

Option #1: Applying Philosophy to a Modern-Day Issue  
In this option, you will complete the following:  

Select a key idea from one of our five philosophers covered in weeks 1-5.  
Apply that key idea to a modern-day context.  
Demonstrate how that key idea helps the reader understand your perspective on the modern-day context.  
For example, you may choose to discuss Plato’s concept of how knowledge changes perspective, and you may apply that idea to a modern-day novel, film, news story, or even a magazine advertisement.  

The choice of what you apply the tool to is your own. By that, you may choose whatever text, or artifact that communicates a message, to apply the tool.  

Imagine, for example, you watched Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure, that film we talked about in our discussion of Plato. You might want to talk about how that film does or does not successfully apply the concepts of Plato to teach the audience about a larger idea.

Note: You may debate whether the text you choose does or does not meet the standards of your chosen philosopher’s ideas.

Remember, too, that you’ve likely done a lot of work on the key themes and examples in our weekly handouts. You can mine ideas and sources from there and from any feedback from your peers.

You have also done a good bit of work on your thesis and/or body paragraphs with your Portfolio Milestone Assignments from weeks 2, 4, and 6. Again, you are encouraged to revisit that work and comments from your Instructor on that work to outline and revise your ideas for the final portfolio project.

Hint: While you are putting together your final discussion presentation in Week 8 discussion, you will also get a chance to review your key ideas and quotes from the class, so be sure to leverage that step in locating key elements of your final paper’s body paragraphs and/or ideas to inform the final thesis, introduction, and conclusion.

Your paper must be two to three pages, 12-point font, double-spaced. That means no 1.5 page papers, and no papers longer than 3 pages. The length of the paper is designed to help you boil down the key ideas into a focused thesis with 3-7 body paragraphs and a conclusion. We are focusing on quality, not quantity. For more on the academic writing process for the final portfolio, review the Week 8 Lecture. 

Include at least two references - one from a philosopher and at least one from a credible outside source. The CSU Global Library is a good place to find these references. To quickly access the Library, click on the tabs in the Course Navigation Panel.
