# --- Module Objective ---
# Package initialization for Architecture tests directory within the MRCA testing framework.
# This module defines constants, shared utilities, and package-level configuration
# for comprehensive architecture testing including confidence validation,
# hallucination prevention, and overall system architecture evaluation.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# --- Module Contents Overview ---
# - Package initialization for architecture tests
# - Test constants and shared utilities for architecture validation
# - ASR (Architecture Significant Requirements) validation constants
# - Configuration for architecture-level testing scenarios
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# --- Dependencies / Imports ---
# - Standard Library: None (package initialization only)
# - Third-Party: None (package initialization only)  
# - Local Project Modules: References parent testing framework constants
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# --- Usage / Integration ---
# This package initialization module is imported automatically when the
# architecture tests package is accessed. It provides shared constants and
# utilities for architecture-level tests including Test Case 5 (Confidence
# Score & Hallucination prevention) and other ASR validation scenarios.
