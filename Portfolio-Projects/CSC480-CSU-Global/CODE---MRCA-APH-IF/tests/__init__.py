MRCA Testing Framework

This package contains formal tests for the Mining Regulatory Compliance Assistant.
These tests complement the existing operational tests embedded in production modules.

Test Categories:
- Unit Tests: Individual component testing
- Integration Tests: Component interaction testing  
- End-to-End Tests: Complete workflow testing
- Reliability Tests: Fault injection and resilience testing
- Architecture Tests: ASR validation and performance testing

Usage:
    pytest tests/                    # Run all tests
    pytest tests/unit/               # Run unit tests only
    pytest -m "unit and not slow"    # Run fast unit tests
    pytest -m requires_neo4j         # Run tests needing Neo4j
