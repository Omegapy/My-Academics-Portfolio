Fab Flowers Employee System - Software Acquisition Proposal
Historically, the management of employee information at Fab Flowers—a flower and gift delivery company—has been two-fold: employees can manage some of their own information, such as submitting vacation requests, in an employee portal, while the human resources department uses a different system to manage such things as employee benefits and vacation accrual and balances.

Management has now identified the need for a new employee system that will allow both human resources and the employee to manage the relevant information in one place. After a full review, and completed requirements gathering, your manager asks you to choose how this will happen; will it be through software acquisition, in-house development, or outsourcing?

Present the pros and cons of software acquisition, in-house development, and outsourcing and recommend the solution you think best fits the company's needs to your manager. Explain your decision.

Prepare a proposal, using the Proposal Template presenting your decision. Your proposal should have: 

- Title Page
- Goals and Objectives of the Project
- Solution
- Recommendations & Conclusions
- References  

Your proposal should be a minimum of 2 pages in length, not including title page using the Proposal Template Download Proposal Template. You should have two credible sources to support your recommended solution. The references, citations and reference page should follow APA7 format. Visit the CSU Global Writing Center for guidance on APA format: this assignment.
