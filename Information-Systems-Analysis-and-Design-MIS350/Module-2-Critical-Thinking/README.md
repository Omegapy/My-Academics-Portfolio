Development Methodologies  
In Module #1, you started a project proposal for Fab Flowers and a new employee system. Continuing your proposal (you will need to insert more headings), you will discuss requirements and the type of methodology that you have chosen for this project. When thinking of requirements (you are crafting these based on the information provided in module #1), make sure you focus on how all departments will use the system for entry and reporting. 

Add to your proposal:

- Include the previous proposal with any changes provided in the feedback from Module #1 from your instructor. 
- Requirements including the stakeholders for each requirement (You should have a minimum of six requirements)
- Methodology selected and the pros and cons of the chosen methodology, and why you chose it over the others.
- Conclusions/Recommendations

Your proposal should be a minimum of 4 pages in length, not including title page using the Proposal Template. Incorporate feedback from the previous submission in this submission. You should have two credible sources to support your recommended solution. The references, citations and reference page should follow APA7 format. Visit the CSU Global Writing Center for guidance on APA format.
