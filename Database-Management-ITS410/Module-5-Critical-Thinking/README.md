Writing Queries

Using the My Guitar Shop database you installed in Module 1, develop the following queries.

1. Write a SELECT statement that returns these columns:  
The count of the number of orders in the Orders table  
he sum of the tax_amount columns in the Orders table  
Execute the query and take a screenshot of the query and the results.  

2. Write a SELECT statement that returns one row for each category that has products with these
columns:  
The category_name column from the Categories table  
The count of the products in the Products table  
The list price of the most expensive product in the Products table.  
Sort the result set so the category with the most products appears first.  
Execute the query, and take a screenshot of the query and the results.  

3. Write a SELECT statement that returns one row for each customer that has orders with these
columns:  
The email_address column from the Customers table  
The sum of the item price in the Order_Items table multiplied by the quantity in the Order_Items table  
The sum of the discount amount column in the Order_Items table multiplied by the quantity in the Order_Items table  
Sort the result set in descending sequence by the item price total for each customer.  
Execute the query and take a screenshot of the query and the results.  

4. Write a SELECT statement that returns one row for each customer that has orders with these
columns:  
The email_address column from the Customers table  
A count of the number of orders  
The total amount for each order (Hint: First, subtract the discount amount from the price. Then, multiply by the quantity.)  
Return only those rows where the customer has more than one order.  
Sort the result set in descending sequence by the sum of the line item amounts.  
Execute the query and take a screenshot of the query and the results  

All the screenshots should show current date. Example of screenshot.
