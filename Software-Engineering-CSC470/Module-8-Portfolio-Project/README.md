The Assignment Direction:    

Option #1: Database Model Draft  
Note: The Portfolio Project, Option #1, consists of three parts. This Milestone will be a draft of the database model. You will incorporate instructor feedback before submitting it with the final Portfolio Project in Module 8.

Create a database model according to the following steps:

Option #1: Database Model  
The Portfolio Project, Option #1, consists of three parts. Please review all three and submit together for grading.
Note: Part 1 was completed as a draft in the Module 7 Portfolio Milestone, Option #1. Please make any updates necessary to that Milestone, being sure to incorporate instructor feedback.  

Part 1: Database Model  
Create a database model while following the steps listed below:  
• Create a simple class diagram containing three classes: Vehicle, Car, and Truck. Provide two attributes for each of these three classes.  
o Create a rough sketch of a relational table that will store the objects belonging to the aforementioned three classes.  
o Ensure you have tried all three options—single table, two tables, and three tables—in your database design.  
o Enter two objects per table, corresponding to the classes.  
• Use the two-table design to recreate a Car object.  
• Repeat the preceding step to recreate a Truck object.
• Create a simple association relationship in a separate class diagram showing Driver and Car.  
o Apply a multiplicity of 1 on the driver side and N on the Car side.  
• Add/modify your table designs to handle storing of two objects belonging to Car and two belonging to Driver.
o Modify the multiplicity on the Driver side to N. This makes it a many-to-many multiplicity.  
• Modify your table designs to handle this multiplicity and show where and how the KEYS or IDs will have to be placed.
• Create a class diagram corresponding to the tables you have designed. Stereotype all classes on that class diagram as <<table>>.  

Part 2: Pseudocode  
Using a programming language of your choice, write a script that will print out pseudocode of your model. Paste the pseudocode in a Word document.

Part 3: Lessons Learned Reflection  
Write a one- to two-page summary that outlines the lessons you have learned in this software engineering course. Reflect on how these lessons can be applied toward more effective software engineering practices and modeling.  
Compile all your work (Parts 1-3) into a single document and submit as a Word or PDF file.  

Your paper must be formatted according to the APA guidelines in the CSU Global Writing Center. The CSU Global Library and Writing Center links can be found in the course navigation panel. Review the Portfolio Project grading rubric for specific grading criteria.
