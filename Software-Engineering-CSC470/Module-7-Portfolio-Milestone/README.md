The Assignment Direction:    

Option #1: Database Model Draft  
Note: The Portfolio Project, Option #1, consists of three parts. This Milestone will be a draft of the database model. You will incorporate instructor feedback before submitting it with the final Portfolio Project in Module 8.

Create a database model according to the following steps:

- Create a simple class diagram containing three classes: Vehicle, Car, and Truck. Provide two attributes for each of these three classes.  
  - Create a rough sketch of a relational table that will store the objects belonging to the aforementioned three classes.
  - Ensure you have tried all three options—single table, two tables, and three tables—in your database design.
  - Enter two objects per table, corresponding to the classes.
- Use the two-table design to recreate a Car object.
- Repeat the preceding step to recreate a Truck object.
- Create a simple association relationship in a separate class diagram showing Driver and Car.
  - Apply a multiplicity of 1 on the driver side and N on the Car side.
- Add/modify your table designs to handle storing of two objects belonging to Car and two belonging to Driver.
   - Modify the multiplicity on the Driver side to N. This makes it a many-to-many multiplicity.
 - Modify your table designs to handle this multiplicity and show where and how the KEYS or IDs will have to be placed.
- Create a class diagram corresponding to the tables you have designed. Stereotype all classes on that class diagram as <<table>>. For each diagram, ensure you are providing a 1-2 page critical analysis that demonstrates your interpretation and integration of the material.
