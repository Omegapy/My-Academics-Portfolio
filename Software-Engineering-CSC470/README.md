-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assignment Description:  

The Assignment Direction:    

Option #1: Sequence Diagrams: Hospital Management System 

We’ve covered sequence diagrams this week. Sequence diagrams in analysis model the behavior of the system from the user’s viewpoint. Thus, sequence diagrams are a good “whiteboard” technique to capture the various usage scenarios described by users. For this week’s Critical Thinking Assignment, create a sequence diagram of a hospital management system. Include the following notations: actor, object, timeline, focus of control, message, self-message, return message, asynchronous message, object destruction, steps (in a sequence), and notes.

Provide sample pseudocode with your sequence diagram activity.

Utilize the assigned readings from the course to complete your activity as well as any applicable outside sources. This activity will vary in length but must conform to APA guidelines in the CSU Global Writing Center. The CSU Global Library and Writing Center links can be found in the course navigation panel.

Please include your diagram and pseudocode in a Word or PDF document and submit for grading. For each diagram, ensure you are providing a 1-2 page critical analysis that demonstrates your interpretation and integration of the material.

## Module 5 Critical Thinking 
Directory: [Module-5-Critical-Thinking](https://github.com/Omegapy/My-Academics-Portfolio/tree/main/Software-Engineering-CSC470/Module-5-Critical-Thinking)   
Title: Critical Thinking Assignment 5: Polymorphism - Using UML Class Diagrams and Pseudocode    

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assignment Description:  

The Assignment Direction:    

Option #1: Polymorphic Class Diagram  
This week, we’ve been discussing polymorphism. Polymorphism is one of the fundamentals of software engineering. Polymorphic behavior implies, at runtime, that the same message has different behavioral effects. For this week’s Critical Thinking Assignment, create a polymorphic class diagram of a design of your choosing. Add an aggregation relationship to this diagram. Write a sample pseudocode script to explain the polymorphic class diagram (see example below; see also Code Example 11.7 in your course textbook).

Additionally, in a one-page paper, explain why polymorphism is a runtime characteristic of object-oriented designs. Describe the structural design necessity to ensure polymorphism at runtime.

Simple code example for polymorphism:  

//This pseudocode indicates that when the driver object issues a call to moveCar, whichever object has been instantiated (FourWheel or FamilyCar) will move.

Class Driver:

     Car myCar;  
     myCar := new FourWheel;  

     myCar.moveCar();  
     myCar := new FamilyCar;  
     myCar.moveCar();  

Utilize the assigned readings from the course to complete your activity. Please cite at least one additional credible or scholarly source to support your analysis and positions. The CSU Global Library is a good place to find scholarly sources. This activity will vary in length however, the written portion should be a minimum of one page in length with document and citation formatting that conforms to APA guidelines in the CSU Global Writing Center. The CSU Global Library and Writing Center links can be found in the course navigation panel.  

Please include your diagram, pseudocode, and writeup in a Word or PDF document and submit for grading.

Title: Critical Thinking Assignment 4: UML Activity Diagram      

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assignment Description:  

Activity Diagram  
This week, we’ve been discussing activity and interaction overview diagrams. Activity diagrams of the UML are meant to show any flow, or process, in the system. For this week’s Critical Thinking Assignment, create a detailed activity diagram that shows partitions, multithreads, and decision points for a scenario of your choosing. In one to two pages, provide an overview of your diagram. Additionally, discuss how multiple threads help to optimize workflows? Provide applicable examples in your discussion.  

Utilize the assigned readings from the course to complete your activity. Please cite at least one additional credible or scholarly source to support your analysis and positions. The CSU Global Library is a good place to find scholarly sources. This activity will vary in length however, the written portion should be one to two pages with document and citation formatting that conforms to APA guidelines in the CSU Global Writing Center. The CSU Global Library and Writing Center links can be found in the course navigation panel.

Title: Critical Thinking Assignment 3: Online Shopping System Use Case Diagram      

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assignment Description:  

Option #1: Use Case Diagram for Online Shopping  
This week, we’ve been discussing actors and use cases. Each use case represents a unit of useful functionality that subjects provide to actors. An association between an actor and a use case indicates that the actor and the use case somehow interact or communicate with each other.

For this week’s Critical Thinking Assignment, create a use case diagram with flows and alternative flows for an online shopping scenario. Provide a 1-2 page overview of your diagram, including a detailed description and analysis of the actor(s) in your diagram.

Utilize the assigned readings from the course to complete your assignment. Please cite at least one additional credible or scholarly source to support your analysis and positions. The CSU Global Library is a good place to find scholarly sources. This activity will vary in length however, the written portion should be a minimum of one page in length with document and citation formatting that conforms to APA guidelines in the CSU Global Writing Center.

## Module 1 Critical Thinking 
Directory: [Module-1-Critical-Thinking](https://github.com/Omegapy/My-Academics-Portfolio/tree/main/Software-Engineering-CSC470/Module-1-Critical-Thinking)   
Title: Critical Thinking Assignment 1: Restaurant Customer Service System      

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assignment Description:  

Critical Thinking Assignment   
Choose one of the following two assignments to complete this week. Do not do both assignments. Identify your assignment choice in the title of your submission.  

Option #1: Business Use Case Model: Restaurant
We’ve covered business use case models this week. A business use case defines what happens in the business when the use case is requested by a business actor; it describes the complete workflow or business process that produces results required or in need of a business actor. Use case behaviors may be described in a natural language text, which is current common practice, or by using UML behavior diagrams for specific behaviors such as:  

activity,   
state machine,  
and interaction.  

For this week’s Critical Thinking Assignment, you are asked to create a business use case diagram for a restaurant. Include several business actors with needs and goals as related to the restaurant and business use cases, expressing expectations of the actors from the business. Your diagram should include both external and internal business views of the restaurant. Based on the diagram that you have created, ensure you are providing a 1-2 page critical analysis that demonstrates your interpretation and integration of the material.  

For assistance in completing this activity, please review this business use case guideline document: https://sceweb.uhcl.edu/helm/RationalUnifiedProcess/process/modguide/md_buc.htm.  

Please paste your diagram to a Word document; then, submit it for grading.
