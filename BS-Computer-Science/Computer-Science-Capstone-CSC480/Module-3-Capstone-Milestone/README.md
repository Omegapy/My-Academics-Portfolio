# Module-3 Capstone Milestone
Program Name: Mining Regulatory Compliance Assistant (MRCA) – Architecture Proposal

Grade: 100% A

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSC480 – Computer Science Capstone  
Professor: Dr. Shaher Daoud
Spring D (25SD) – 2025   
Student: Alexander (Alex) Ricciardi   
Date: 06/29/2025   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assignment Directions:  

For this assignment, finalize a detailed design for the new software system that was approved for your Capstone Project.

Provide an in-depth explanation of the components of the project. The submission, at minimum, must include a sufficient description of the architecture of your system, such as the following:

- Abstract interfaces used by your system
- Inheritance hierarchies present in your solution
- The different states of the system during its run-time
- Data structures used by your components
- System inputs and outputs
- A user interface description

Your written submission should be clear, well written, concise, and logical, using excellent grammar and style. You will be graded in part on the quality of your writing. If you need assistance with your writing style or want to review writing tools, resources, and templates, visit the CSU Global Writing Center (link available in the left navigation panel).

Your paper should be approximately two pages in length (not including the title and reference pages) and conform to APA guidelines in the CSU Global Writing Center (link available in the left navigation panel). Include at least two credible references in addition to the course textbooks. The CSU Global Library (link available in the left navigation panel)is a good place to find these references. Format your paper to include a title page, section headers, an introduction, a conclusion, and a reference page.

Program Description:  
The Mining Regulatory Compliance Assistant (MRCA), is an AI-powered web application that will provide a quick, reliable, and easy way to query Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) regulations using natural language. MRCA combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with an a novel RAG tecnique, Advanced Parallel HybridRAG (APH), to minimize LLM hallucinations.

Note that Advanced Parallel HybridRAG (APH) is a novel RAG technique developed by Alexander Samuel Ricciardi (me) that uses intelligence fusion to combine results from two processes performed in parallel: a semantic search across vector embeddings and a traversal search over a knowledge graph.
