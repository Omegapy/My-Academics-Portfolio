Assignment Directions:  

Software Project Plan  
Research a realistic software project that can be used in a business, identify a business problem that can be solved with a new software solution, and justify the implementation of the new system based on your research.

You will develop your project throughout the course through the following Capstone Milestone submissions:  
- Topic Approval (due in Module 1)
- Proposal (due in Module 2)
- Software Design (due in Module 3)
- Software Project Plan (due in Module 4)
- Fault-Tolerant Software Plan (due in Module 5)

Module 2: Capstone Milestone  
Project Proposal

An introduction to your topic (refined from Module 1 based on instructor feedback)
A description of the information system that is going to solve or enhance the business problem you identified
A description of the major software (e.g., classes) components that will comprise your solution
An implementation timeline estimate for your project
Your written submission should be clear, well written, concise, and logical, using excellent grammar and style. You will be graded in part on the quality of your writing. If you need assistance with your writing style or want to review writing tools, resources, and templates, visit the CSU Global Writing Center.

Your paper should be approximately two pages in length (not including the title and reference pages) and conform to APA guidelines in the CSU Global Writing Center (link available in the left navigation panel). Include at least two credible references in addition to the course textbooks. The CSU Global Library (link available in the left navigation panel) is a good place to find these references. Format your paper to include a title page, section headers, an introduction, a conclusion, and a reference page.

Program Description:  
The MRCA is an AI-powered conversational agent that retrieves information and answers questions about Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) regulations, as outlined in Title 30 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). It allows users to quickly and easily access information and ask questions about MSHA regulations using a Large Language Model (LLM) combined with a GraphRAG hybrid search.
