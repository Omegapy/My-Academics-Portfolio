## **What is MRCA?**

MRCA (Mining Regulatory Compliance Assistant) is a web application that uses an AI system to provide quick, reliable, 
and easy access to MSHA (Mine Safety and Health Administration) regulations using natural language queries. 
Built on novel **Advanced Parallel HybridRAG - Intelligent Fusion (APH-IF)** technology.

### **Core Innovation: Advanced Parallel HybridRAG - Intelligent Fusion (APH-IF)**

Unlike traditional (basic) RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems that use *sequential* processing, 
MRCA implements **Advanced Parallel HybridRAG (APH)** that performs **concurrent VectorRAG (semantic search) 
and GraphRAG (traversal search) queries** 
and fuses the queries results using **Intelligent Context Fusion (IF)** using a LLM or a LRM:

- **Traditional RAG**: `if condition: vector_search() else: graph_search()`
- **MRCA's Innovation**: `asyncio.gather(vector_task, graph_task)` - parallelism - `intelligent_context_fusion`

This approach combines:
- **VectorRAG**: Semantic similarity search using 768-dimensional Gemini embeddings
- **GraphRAG**: Knowledge graph traversal with automated Cypher generation
- **Context Fusion**: Intelligent combination using 4 research-based fusion strategies
- **Hybrid Templates**: 5 specialized response templates for different use cases

Title: Module 7 Capstone Milestone: Software Configuration Management

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assignment Description:  
  
Situations may arise during technical implementation of a project where tracking software changes is necessary. For example, it may be necessary to revert to an earlier version of code or implement additional or removed functionality.

Your capstone project demands a meticulously crafted document, spanning 3-4 pages, outlining your bespoke Software Configuration Management (SCM) process adhering to APA format as per CSU Global Writing Center guidelines. This document will be your compass for navigating software changes, ensuring stability, and fostering seamless project evolution.

Delving into the SCM Process:
- Detailed Methodology: Define a clear roadmap for managing changes, encompassing meticulous procedures for tracking modifications, minimizing errors, and safeguarding against pitfalls.
- Seamless Evolution: Clearly articulate the steps involved in your SCM process, demonstrating how it enables uninterrupted project development while maintaining robust stability.

Unveiling the Power of your SCM Solution:
- Functionalities and Benefits: Elucidate the functionalities and advantages of your chosen SCM solution, specifically highlighting its prowess in monitoring, tracing, and reverting code alterations.
- Risk Mitigation and Success: Showcase how your SCM solution underpins project success by mitigating potential risks and ensuring smooth progression.

Polishing the Document:
- APA Adherence: Ensure your paper meets APA formatting, citation, and referencing standards as specified by the CSU Global Writing Center.
- Logical Structure: Organize your document for intuitive navigation and comprehension. Utilize clear headings and subheadings to guide readers through your SCM process.

Testing Plan Organization:
- Dedicated Sections: Structure your testing plan with distinct sections for each essential test case, making it an easily digestible roadmap for quality assurance.
- Justification: Provide compelling justifications for your chosen testing methodologies, referencing at least three credible sources beyond course textbooks. Leverage the CSU Global Library to access relevant resources.

Harnessing Available Resources:
- Navigation Panel: Utilize the course navigation panel to access vital resources like the CSU Global Writing Center and Library, empowering you to craft a robust document.
- References: Back up your testing methodologies and SCM process descriptions with credible citations from reputable sources to lend credibility and depth.

By meticulously fulfilling these requirements and documenting your comprehensive SCM process, you'll not only deliver a robust and informative document but also demonstrate your mastery of managing software changes and ensuring project stability through effective SCM practices. This document will stand as a testament to your commitment to quality and your ability to navigate the complexities of software development.

Program Description:  
The Mining Regulatory Compliance Assistant (MRCA), is an AI-powered web application that will provide a quick, reliable, and easy way to query Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) regulations using natural language. MRCA combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with an a novel RAG tecnique, Advanced Parallel HybridRAG - Inteligent Fusion  (APH-IF), to minimize LLM hallucinations.

Note that Advanced Parallel HybridRAG - Inteligent Fusion (APH-IF) is a novel RAG technique developed by Alexander Samuel Ricciardi (me) that uses intelligence fusion to combine results from two processes performed in parallel: a semantic search across vector embeddings and a traversal search over a knowledge graph.

Title: Module 1 Capstone Milestone: Topic Approva

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assignment Description:  

Software Project Plan  
Research a realistic software project that can be used in a business, identify a business problem that can be solved with a new software solution, and justify the implementation of the new system based on your research.

You will develop your project throughout the course through the following Capstone Milestone submissions:  
- Topic Approval (due in Module 1)
- Proposal (due in Module 2)
- Software Design (due in Module 3)
- Software Project Plan (due in Module 4)
- Fault-Tolerant Software Plan (due in Module 5)
- System Test (due in Module 6)
- Packaging the Solution (due in Module 7)
- Final Capstone Project (due in Module 8)

While each milestone will be worth points, the final submission due in Module 8 will be a compilation of the submissions from Modules 1-7 and will constitute a significant percentage of the course point total. (See the syllabus for details.) The final submission must integrate feedback provided by the instructor in previous modules.

Module 1 Capstone Milestone

For your first milestone, carefully examine the capstone project requirements for the Module 8 Capstone Project. Then select a topic and write two to four paragraphs that describe the selection and what the final capstone project will entail. Your instructor will provide feedback on and approval of your topic.

Suggested Topics

When selecting a topic, try to narrow the topic as much as possible and research one specific area in depth. A generic topic such as "Databases on the Internet" is much too broad and will not be acceptable. It is also recommended that you select a topic that aligns with your program specialization. Possible topics include:
- An Android chat application
- A front-end to a database
- A web-mapping application
- A shopping cart for an on-line business
- A video game involving two or more players
- A scientific graphing calculator
- A simulation of a dynamical system
- An optimized routing system
- A scheduling system
- On-line testing system for multiple choice tests

Instead of these topics, you may wish to select a problem in your work environment that needs attention, is related to your major, and is of particular interest to you. Many students choose such projects. One example is a process for remote collaboration in a geographically dispersed development team. The project involved interviewing participants, evaluating and choosing tools, installing the tools and developing a process around them, and finally using the new process on an ongoing project.
