Assignment Directions:  

For this course, you have researched the implementation of a software system and have prepared a comprehensive, final capstone project and paper summarizing your work and findings. Your capstone solution should be based on a realistic software requirement, where you have identified an application that can be solved with a new software solution, where you have proposed the use of a new system for a business, where you have established a business case for the solution, and where you have justified the implementation of the new system based on your research.

In this module, you will finalize your project, integrate the feedback provided by your instructor from previous modules, and incorporate professional software development standards. 

Your final Capstone Project report should be approximately eight pages in length and conform to APA guidelines in the CSU Global Writing Center (link available in left navigation panel). 

Organize your project report using headings for each of the required sections:

- Topic Approval (due in Module 1)
- Proposal (due in Module 2)
- Software Design (due in Module 3)
- Software Project Plan (due in Module 4)
- Fault-Tolerant Software Plan (due in Module 5)
- System Test (due in Module 6)
- Packaging the Solution (due in Module 7)
- Final Capstone Project (due in Module 8)

Include subheadings for each section as appropriate. Be sure to include an introduction and a conclusion for your final submission report. Support the project using at least six credible references in addition to the course textbooks. The CSU Global Library (link available in left navigation panel) is a good place to find these references. 

Be sure to carefully review the submission requirements for each milestone in the module in which it is assigned. While each milestone is worth points, the final submission due in Module 8 is a compilation of all the submissions from Modules 1-7 and will constitute a significant percentage of the course point total. (See the syllabus for details.)

⚠️ This project has limited funds (I am a student). Once the monthly LLM usage fund limit is reached, the application will stop providing responses and will display an error message.  
Please contact me (a.omegapy@gmail.com) if this happend and you still want to try the application.

## **What is MRCA?**

MRCA (Mining Regulatory Compliance Assistant) is a web application that uses an AI system to provide quick, reliable, 
and easy access to MSHA (Mine Safety and Health Administration) regulations using natural language queries. 
Built on novel **Advanced Parallel HybridRAG - Intelligent Fusion (APH-IF)** technology.

### **Core Innovation: Advanced Parallel HybridRAG - Intelligent Fusion (APH-IF)**

Unlike traditional (basic) RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems that use *sequential* processing, 
MRCA implements **Advanced Parallel HybridRAG (APH)** that performs **concurrent VectorRAG (semantic search) 
and GraphRAG (traversal search) queries** 
and fuses the queries results using **Intelligent Context Fusion (IF)** using a LLM or a LRM:

- **Traditional RAG**: `if condition: vector_search() else: graph_search()`
- **MRCA's Innovation**: `asyncio.gather(vector_task, graph_task)` - parallelism - `intelligent_context_fusion`

This approach combines:
- **VectorRAG**: Semantic similarity search using 768-dimensional Gemini embeddings
- **GraphRAG**: Knowledge graph traversal with automated Cypher generation
- **Context Fusion**: Intelligent combination using 4 research-based fusion strategies
- **Hybrid Templates**: 5 specialized response templates for different use cases
