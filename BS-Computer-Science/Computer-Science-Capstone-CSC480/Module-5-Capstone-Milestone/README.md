Assignment Directions:  

Fault-tolerant Software  
"Fault-tolerant" software is software that contains controls that keep your system from crashing or aborting. An example of fault-tolerant software would be a program that does not abort when a user enters improper data.

Investigate some of the ways in which software implementation can incorporate fault-tolerance. Next, describe ways in which your Capstone Project incorporates principles of fault-tolerance.
Your paper should be approximately two pages in length (not including the title and reference pages) and conform to APA guidelines in the CSU Global Writing Center (link available in the left navigation panel). Include at least two credible references in addition to the course textbook. The CSU Global Library (link available in the left navigation panel) is a good place to find these references. Format your paper to include a title page, section headers, an introduction, a conclusion, and a reference page.

Program Description:  
The Mining Regulatory Compliance Assistant (MRCA), is an AI-powered web application that will provide a quick, reliable, and easy way to query Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) regulations using natural language. MRCA combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with an a novel RAG tecnique, Advanced Parallel HybridRAG (APH), to minimize LLM hallucinations.

Note that Advanced Parallel HybridRAG (APH) is a novel RAG technique developed by Alexander Samuel Ricciardi (me) that uses intelligence fusion to combine results from two processes performed in parallel: a semantic search across vector embeddings and a traversal search over a knowledge graph.
