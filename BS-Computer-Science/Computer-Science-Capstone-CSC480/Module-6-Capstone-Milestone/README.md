# Module-6 Capstone Milestone
Program Name: Mining Regulatory Compliance Assistant (MRCA) – Testing Plan

Grade: 100% A

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSC480 – Computer Science Capstone  
Professor: Dr. Shaher Daoud
Spring D (25SD) – 2025   
Student: Alexander (Alex) Ricciardi   
Date: 07/20/2025   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assignment Directions:  

Software Project Plan  
For this milestone, you will draft a document that specifies how to test your Capstone Project. Investigate different types of software testing methodologies. Describe the following:

- At least five use cases that your capstone project must respond to
- A set of inputs that can be used to drive your project and the corresponding results from your system
- Performance expectations

A set of inputs and/or user interactions that can cause your program to fail
Your paper should be approximately 3 pages in length and conform to APA guidelines in the CSU Global Writing Center (link available in the left navigation panel). Organize your testing plan with headings for each of the required test cases. Justify your testing methods with at least three credible references in addition to the course textbooks. The CSU Global Library (link available in the left navigation panel) is a good place to find these references.

Program Description:  
The Mining Regulatory Compliance Assistant (MRCA), is an AI-powered web application that will provide a quick, reliable, and easy way to query Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) regulations using natural language. MRCA combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with an a novel RAG tecnique, Advanced Parallel HybridRAG (APH), to minimize LLM hallucinations.

Note that Advanced Parallel HybridRAG (APH) is a novel RAG technique developed by Alexander Samuel Ricciardi (me) that uses intelligence fusion to combine results from two processes performed in parallel: a semantic search across vector embeddings and a traversal search over a knowledge graph.
