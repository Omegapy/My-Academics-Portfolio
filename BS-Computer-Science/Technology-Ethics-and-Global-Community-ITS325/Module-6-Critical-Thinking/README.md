Internet Rulings, Laws, and Regulations  
From this module's Global Internet Law in a Nutshell readings choose three rulings, laws, or regulations that relate in some way to your use of the internet. In a well-written paper, briefly summarize each case, law or regulation and describe the effect it has or could have on your internet use. How thorough is the privacy protection offered by each ruling, law or regulation? What, if any, suggestions would you have for changing each ruling, law, or regulation to strengthen privacy rights?

Your paper should be well written and meet the following requirements:

- Your paper should be 2-3 pages in length, not including the cover page and references page.
- Your paper must be formatted according to APA guidelines in the CSU Global Writing Center (available in the left-hand navigation panel).

- All references must be cited in the text and listed on the references page, according to APA formatting.
