### My Submission 

Answer-First Analytics (DBEM) as an Ethical Failure in Software Engineering and AI

This paper argues that Decision-Based Evidence Making (DBEM) becomes an ethical failure in software engineering and AI when organizations start with a desired conclusion and then shape analytics to justify it, rather than using evidence to discover truth, risks, and tradeoffs. The author explains that this answer-first approach undermines honesty, transparency, accountability, fairness, and privacy, and can lead to harmful outcomes disguised as “objective” analysis, including what the paper calls governance theater. The Volkswagen emissions scandal is used as a concrete example of DBEM in practice, showing how software was designed to simulate compliance instead of achieving real compliance, resulting in public harm and major financial and reputational consequences.
