### My Submission 

The Ethics of Behavioral Analytics and Political Microtargeting

This paper argues that behavioral analytics and political microtargeting can improve campaign outreach and voter engagement, but they also create serious ethical risks, including privacy violations, weak consent, psychological manipulation, and potential voter suppression. It maintains that software engineers are not neutral bystanders in this process and must build ethical safeguards—such as data minimization, fairness, transparency, explainability, and accountability—directly into political analytics systems. The paper concludes that protecting democratic integrity requires both campaigns and developers to prioritize voter autonomy and public transparency over pure performance metrics.
