### My Submission 

Ethical Frameworks in Software Engineering

This essay argues that because software and AI engineering are becoming synonymous, ethics must be treated as a core software quality attribute rather than an optional constraint to prevent the accumulation of "ethical debt". The author evaluates the Federal Data Strategy’s Data Ethics Framework, illustrating how its seven tenets—such as upholding statutes, respecting privacy, and promoting transparency—can be translated into actionable engineering requirements like "compliance-by-design," privacy-impact assessments, and automated security scanning. Ultimately, it recommends embedding these ethical controls directly into the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and MLOps stages to ensure that AI-driven systems remain accountable, socially responsible, and free from biases that cause public harm.
