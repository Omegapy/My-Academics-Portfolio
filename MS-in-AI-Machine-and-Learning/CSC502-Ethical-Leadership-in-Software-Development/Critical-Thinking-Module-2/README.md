### My Submission 

Ethical Responsibility in Data Processing

The provided essay explores the concept of ethical debt, defining it as the accumulation of future costs and social harms resulting from ethical shortcuts taken during software development. While technical debt typically impacts developers through higher maintenance costs, the author uses case studies like Clearview AI and the Dutch childcare benefits scandal to demonstrate that ethical debt is often "paid" by society through privacy loss, discrimination, and human rights violations. Ultimately, the paper argues that developers have an ethical obligation to embed formal ethical frameworks into their processes to prevent these catastrophic consequences and preserve public trust.
