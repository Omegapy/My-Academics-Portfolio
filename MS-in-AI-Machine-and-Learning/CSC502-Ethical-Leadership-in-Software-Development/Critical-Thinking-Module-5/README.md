### My Submission 

Data Governance in Software Engineering and AI

This paper argues that data governance is essential in software engineering and AI because technical controls alone (like pipelines, validation checks, and access controls) do not define decision rights, accountability, or organizational rules for how data should be used. It explains that strong data governance improves data quality, usability, stewardship, and reusability while reducing operational complexity and helping teams manage privacy, security, and compliance risks. The paper concludes that data governance is the bridge between technical controls and organizational decision-making, making AI and software systems more trustworthy, auditable, and responsible across their full life cycles.
