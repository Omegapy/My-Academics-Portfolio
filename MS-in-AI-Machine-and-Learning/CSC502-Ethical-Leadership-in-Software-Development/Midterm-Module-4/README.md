### Assignment Directions:  

Option #1: Drones and GIS  
There are ethical issues that can arise when using drone technologies. In this assignment, you are to utilize at least four sources to identify potential ethical issues that relate to the use of drone technologies.

Submission Instructions:  
- Provide an in-depth analysis of the four main areas and summarize your analysis using a slide presentation. You may use PowerPoint or another presentation tool such as Prezi.
Your slide presentation should consist of a minimum of six to seven slides, not including the required cover and references slides.
- Support your analysis using at least three authoritative literary sources, which are cited using correct APA styling.

### My Submission 

Drone GIS Ethics: Privacy, Safety, Security, and Equity in GIS Technologies

The presentation argues that drone-enabled GIS can create major public benefits (planning, monitoring, decision support) while also introducing serious ethical risks involving privacy, surveillance, safety, cybersecurity, and data misuse. It emphasizes governance controls such as data minimization, retention limits, pilot training, FAA-style operational discipline, encryption, access controls, audit logs, and bias review for AI-supported geospatial analysis. Its central recommendation is a practical ethics framework with checklists and tiered access to publicly funded geospatial data, balancing transparency and public value against privacy, security, and equity harms.
