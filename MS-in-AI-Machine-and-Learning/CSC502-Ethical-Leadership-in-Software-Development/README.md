## Project Description:

This repository is a collection of assignments from CSC502 – Ethical Leadership in Software Development at Colorado State University Global - CSU Global.  

**CSC502 - Ethical-Leadership-in-Software-Development**   

This course emphasizes ethical practices behind software engineering as an applied professional practice. To that end, the course is structured as a series of readings, case studies, questions and discussion prompts that provoke the practice of ethical reflection, questioning, and decision making. Theoretical foundations of ethics are briefly presented in each of the modules how to define the range of ethical perspectives that can be useful to employ in professional life. For further expansion of the existing literature in software engineering /computer ethics, or in the area of philosophical ethics more generally, students will find helpful suggestions for additional research in the recommended readings.

Course Learning Outcomes:
1. Examine legal, ethical, and societal implications surrounding software development and data management.
2. Analyze ethical situations in programming and software development.
3. Evaluate solutions for sample ethical cases.
4. Determine solutions for ethical questions.
5. Create ethical organizational policies for specific issues.

Data Governance in Software Engineering and AI

This paper argues that data governance is essential in software engineering and AI because technical controls alone (like pipelines, validation checks, and access controls) do not define decision rights, accountability, or organizational rules for how data should be used. It explains that strong data governance improves data quality, usability, stewardship, and reusability while reducing operational complexity and helping teams manage privacy, security, and compliance risks. The paper concludes that data governance is the bridge between technical controls and organizational decision-making, making AI and software systems more trustworthy, auditable, and responsible across their full life cycles.

Drone GIS Ethics: Privacy, Safety, Security, and Equity in GIS Technologies

The presentation argues that drone-enabled GIS can create major public benefits (planning, monitoring, decision support) while also introducing serious ethical risks involving privacy, surveillance, safety, cybersecurity, and data misuse. It emphasizes governance controls such as data minimization, retention limits, pilot training, FAA-style operational discipline, encryption, access controls, audit logs, and bias review for AI-supported geospatial analysis. Its central recommendation is a practical ethics framework with checklists and tiered access to publicly funded geospatial data, balancing transparency and public value against privacy, security, and equity harms.

Answer-First Analytics (DBEM) as an Ethical Failure in Software Engineering and AI

This paper argues that Decision-Based Evidence Making (DBEM) becomes an ethical failure in software engineering and AI when organizations start with a desired conclusion and then shape analytics to justify it, rather than using evidence to discover truth, risks, and tradeoffs. The author explains that this answer-first approach undermines honesty, transparency, accountability, fairness, and privacy, and can lead to harmful outcomes disguised as “objective” analysis, including what the paper calls governance theater. The Volkswagen emissions scandal is used as a concrete example of DBEM in practice, showing how software was designed to simulate compliance instead of achieving real compliance, resulting in public harm and major financial and reputational consequences.

Title: Critical Thinking Assignment 3: Ethical Frameworks in Software Engineering

---

#### Assignment Description:  

Ethical Frameworks     
Research the concept of ethical frameworks. Review and critically analyze the US Government’s [Data Ethics Framewor](https://resources.data.gov/assets/documents/fds-data-ethics-framework.pdf), published in December 2020 as part of the Federal Data Strategy (United States Government OMB, 2020). Draft a five page paper and use relevant examples from software engineering to illustrate and evaluate the framework’s principles and their practical implications.

Submission Instructions:  
- Your paper must be five pages long, not including the required cover and references pages.
- Submit your Word document using the file name: CSC502_Module3_LastName_FirstName.docx.
- Support your analysis using at least three authoritative literary sources, which are cited using correct APA styling.

#### My Submission  

Ethical Frameworks in Software Engineering

This essay argues that because software and AI engineering are becoming synonymous, ethics must be treated as a core software quality attribute rather than an optional constraint to prevent the accumulation of "ethical debt". The author evaluates the Federal Data Strategy’s Data Ethics Framework, illustrating how its seven tenets—such as upholding statutes, respecting privacy, and promoting transparency—can be translated into actionable engineering requirements like "compliance-by-design," privacy-impact assessments, and automated security scanning. Ultimately, it recommends embedding these ethical controls directly into the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and MLOps stages to ensure that AI-driven systems remain accountable, socially responsible, and free from biases that cause public harm.

#### My Submission  

Ethical Responsibility in Data Processing

The provided essay explores the concept of ethical debt, defining it as the accumulation of future costs and social harms resulting from ethical shortcuts taken during software development. While technical debt typically impacts developers through higher maintenance costs, the author uses case studies like Clearview AI and the Dutch childcare benefits scandal to demonstrate that ethical debt is often "paid" by society through privacy loss, discrimination, and human rights violations. Ultimately, the paper argues that developers have an ethical obligation to embed formal ethical frameworks into their processes to prevent these catastrophic consequences and preserve public trust.

#### My Submission  

Ethical Responsibility in Data Processing 

The essay challenges the reductive view of data processing as a neutral technical task, arguing instead that it is a curatorial process where every decision carries significant ethical implications. To prevent the encoding of harmful biases, it proposes an ethical framework rooted in four human rights principles: Dignity, Autonomy, Necessity, and the Common Good. Real-world ethical failures, such as the OkCupid data release and Amazon's biased recruiting tool, demonstrate the necessity of interrogating the rationale behind technical choices to ensure they serve the public interest.
