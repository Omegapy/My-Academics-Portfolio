**Assignment Directions:**  
 
Scope Management - Webpage Development  
You have recently been hired to the project management team for a 3D printer company. They're deploying a new customer-facing webpage showcasing their different 3D printing products as well as filaments and spools. 

In this assignment, you must:
- Discuss the plan scope management process for deploying this webpage.
- Explain the inputs, tools, techniques, and outputs that will be part of this deployment.
- Discuss a project lifecycle plan, development approach, and some of the tools and techniques that may be utilized in the deployment of this process.

Think about discussing possible security issues with the site, hardware, and configuration as well. 

Your paper should be 1-2 pages in length and conform to the CSU Global Writing Center (which can be accessed by selecting the button in the left-hand Canvas navigation panel). Include at least two credible references in addition to the course textbook. The CSU Global Library(which can be accessed by selecting the button in the left-hand Canvas navigation panel) is a good place to find these references.
