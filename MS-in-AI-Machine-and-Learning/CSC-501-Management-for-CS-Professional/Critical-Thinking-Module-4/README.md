**Assignment Directions:**  
 
Discovering Common Ground
Project Management provides a unique perspective on designing systems and discusses developing your own understanding of the client's mission and wants or needs regarding the project. This includes the resources and team provided to accomplish the task. There is a lot of data on how to use resources, budget, stakeholders, and users together in a project so that the project is successful. For the Critical Thinking Assignment this week research methods on overcoming challenges in a project from resources, budget, goals, stakeholder support, and people involved in the team. 

- Create a dialogue scenario that discusses a conflict between departments and possible ways of solving them. 
- Discuss the methods of negotiation that will be utilized to try and find a common ground between the stakeholders.
- Showcase expert commentary along with industry-standard research and discussion from the text for how you would appropriately resolve the conflict to keep the project moving forward.
 

Your paper should be 1-2 pages in length and conform to the CSU Global Writing Center (which can be accessed by selecting the button in the left-hand Canvas navigation panel). Include at least two credible references in addition to the course textbook. The CSU Global Library (which can be accessed by selecting the button in the left-hand Canvas navigation panel) is a good place to find these references.
