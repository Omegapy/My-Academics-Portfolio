Module 3: Portfolio Milestone

My project:  
For my CSC501 portfolio project, I chose a project management approach to develop and implement a software system called Project Codebase, a personal project. However, to meet the CSC501 portfolio project requirements, I have reframed the Project Codebase project as a fictional internal system being developed by a company called Omega.py (I own the omegapy.com domain). The goal of the project is to manage the development and implementation of an intelligent platform/AI agent that would assist Omega.py software engineers and AI coding agents in understanding existing and being developed software codebases and architectures.

A key component of a project's success is stakeholder engagement. The Stakeholder Engagement Assessment report provides a Stakeholder Engagement Assessment Matrix for the Omega.py Project Codebase, along with a quick use case study detailing current and desired engagement levels, and strategies to transition stakeholders to their desired engagement level.
