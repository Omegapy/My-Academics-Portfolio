#### Assignment Directions:    

Module 7: Portfolio Project  
System Planning and Process    
For your Portfolio Project in this course, you will discuss the creation of a fictitious system and create a mock plan and process for this system. You will be submitting milestones for this project each week, and these milestones will be compiled and finalized in the final Portfolio Project.

Module 1 - System Selection   
Module 2 - Engagement Level Diagram   
Module 3 - The Project Plan  
Module 4 - The Project Design and Outline   
Module 5 - Design Methodology   
Module 6 - The Risk Matrix   

Make sure to tie them together well, include all the references, and formalize the paper as you go through the instructor feedback for all your assignments.

My project:  
For my CSC501 portfolio project, I chose a project management approach to develop and implement a software system called Project Codebase, a personal project. However, to meet the CSC501 portfolio project requirements, I have reframed the Project Codebase project as a fictional internal system being developed by a company called Omega.py (I own the omegapy.com domain). The goal of the project is to manage the development and implementation of an intelligent platform/AI agent that would assist Omega.py software engineers and AI coding agents in understanding existing and being developed software codebases and architectures.

A key component of a project's success is stakeholder engagement. The Stakeholder Engagement Assessment report provides a Stakeholder Engagement Assessment Matrix for the Omega.py Project Codebase, along with a quick use case study detailing current and desired engagement levels, and strategies to transition stakeholders to their desired engagement level.
