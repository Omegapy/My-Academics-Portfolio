## Portfolio Milestone Module 2  
Directory: [Portfolio-Milestone-Module-2](https://github.com/Omegapy/My-Academics-Portfolio/tree/main/MS-in-AI-Machine-and-Learning/CSC-501-Management-for-CS-Professional/Portfolio-Milestone-Module-2)   
Title: Module 2 Portfolio Milestone: Stakeholder Engagement Assessment

---

Assignment Description:   
Module 2: Portfolio Milestone

Engagement Level Diagram  
Utilize Lucidchart (Links to an external site.) to draw out an engagement level diagram for the core stakeholders in your chosen company from Portfolio Milestone 1. You should create a Stakeholder Engagement Assessment Matrix (Page 45 of uCertify textbook) and then draw up a quick use case study on each of the five engagement levels and why a particular person is in that engagement level.

Review the Get Started with Lucidchart article for information on how to access and use this tool.

Download your chart from Lucidchart as a PDF or a JPEG as explained in the guide and submit it by the posted due date.

My project:  
For my CSC501 portfolio project, I chose a project management approach to develop and implement a software system called Project Codebase, a personal project. However, to meet the CSC501 portfolio project requirements, I have reframed the Project Codebase project as a fictional internal system being developed by a company called Omega.py (I own the omegapy.com domain). The goal of the project is to manage the development and implementation of an intelligent platform/AI agent that would assist Omega.py software engineers and AI coding agents in understanding existing and being developed software codebases and architectures.

A key component of a project's success is stakeholder engagement. The Stakeholder Engagement Assessment report provides a Stakeholder Engagement Assessment Matrix for the Omega.py Project Codebase, along with a quick use case study detailing current and desired engagement levels, and strategies to transition stakeholders to their desired engagement level.


Stakeholder Engagement Assessment Matrix for the Project Codebase within Omega.py, along with a quick use case study detailing engagement levels and explaining why each stakeholder is currently at that level.

Assignment Description:  
Module 1: Portfolio Milestone

System Selection - Paper  
For your Portfolio Project in this course, you will discuss the creation of a fictitious system and create a mock plan and process for this system. You will be submitting milestones for this project each week, and these milestones will be compiled and finalized in the final Portfolio Project.

For this first milestone, you must decide on the system and submit the system you have selected to your instructor. Remember, it is not necessary to choose one of these topics, but these are good options if you are having trouble coming up with an idea.

- An In-depth Analysis of Metropolitan Area Network planning in ABC (Case Study with MAN networks in ABC)
- Analyzing the financial recordkeeping and purchasing of SMEs within tech departments in ABC (A Comparison of SMEs that both do and don't utilize financials records from ABC)  
- Design and Implementation of a Software Life Expectancy Model for a Software Program
- Design and Implementation of a Project Management API using Python and Blockchain Technology
- A Review of the Software Project Abandonment in ABC (A case study of ABC)
- An In-depth Analysis of the Effects of Poor or Non-standard Naming Conventions and storage on SAN and NAS systems in ABC (A case study of DHL ABC)
- Analyzing the relevance of Soft Skills in Technical Employees in Businesses in ABC (A case study of ABC Company)
- Analyzing the role of project management soft skills to increase project success rates - Review of statistically meaningful and documented evidence in ABC Company
