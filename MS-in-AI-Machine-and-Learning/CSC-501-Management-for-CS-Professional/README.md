My project:  
For my CSC501 portfolio project, I chose a project management approach to develop and implement a software system called Project Codebase, a personal project. However, to meet the CSC501 portfolio project requirements, I have reframed the Project Codebase project as a fictional internal system being developed by a company called Omega.py (I own the omegapy.com domain). The goal of the project is to manage the development and implementation of an intelligent platform/AI agent that would assist Omega.py software engineers and AI coding agents in understanding existing and being developed software codebases and architectures.

A key component of a project's success is stakeholder engagement. The Stakeholder Engagement Assessment report provides a Stakeholder Engagement Assessment Matrix for the Omega.py Project Codebase, along with a quick use case study detailing current and desired engagement levels, and strategies to transition stakeholders to their desired engagement level.

Title: Critical Thinking Module 5: Project Portfolio Evaluation

---
---

Assignment Description:   

Discovering Common Ground  
Making a Choice   
You have just been made project manager for top-flight Project Management, Inc. For your first task, you've been handed three separate portfolios for potential projects. The prospectuses are listed as follows:

1. Build a MAN network for the city. The project requires an investment of $10 million of capital. The city has recently passed legislation to allow your firm to install the MAN network. Based on the estimates for traffic passing over the MAN network, the monthlies would be around $500,000 a month after the second year. The city will be collecting all of the dues for the first year and half for the second.
2. Set up computers and networks for the County school district. This project requires the investment of $1 million for the network and computer systems as well as a few servers and an NAS. The city has passed legislation that would allow you to recover the costs of assembly with standard rates as well as a service contract to keep things running after deployment. This amounts to approximately $50,000 a month after the first year.   
3. Build a housing network. This project requires the investment of $10 million up front in building costs, including zoning and a city planning commission. This project will feature 12 single-family residences that will be put up for sale at around $450,000 per residence. Additionally, the project includes a multifamily unit complex featuring 110 units that will bring in a monthly income of $70,000 after the second year, given one year to build and an estimated year to sell and fill the new multifamily structure. Since the firm does not have $10 million in liquidity, the project would require either bringing in a partner or borrowing the funds at an interest rate of 10% per annum.   
 

Given the above choices, which option has the shortest payback period? Which has the longest? Given your knowledge of costs, make your selection for which project you think should be pursued and why. Discuss in detail your evaluation of the project and the reasons for your selection. Discuss any Pro’s and Con’s for your choices. 

 
Your paper should be 1-2 pages in length and conform to the CSU Global Writing Center (which can be accessed by selecting the button in the left-hand Canvas navigation panel). Include at least two credible references in addition to the course textbook. The CSU Global Library (which can be accessed by selecting the button in the left-hand Canvas navigation panel) is a good place to find these references.

Assignment Description:   
Module 4: Portfolio Milestone - Project Design and Outline 
Submit your project plan with budget, resources, and stakeholder analysis. By now, you should have a viable project plan for your portfolio project. You can include diagrams, charts, and a rough outline for your project, including the project scope and timeline estimates for inception, delivery, and maintenance. You should also discuss possible change requests and goal alignments.

Title: Critical Thinking Module 4: Discovering Common Ground

---
---

Assignment Description:   

Discovering Common Ground  
Project Management provides a unique perspective on designing systems and discusses developing your own understanding of the client's mission and wants or needs regarding the project. This includes the resources and team provided to accomplish the task. There is a lot of data on how to use resources, budget, stakeholders, and users together in a project so that the project is successful. For the Critical Thinking Assignment this week research methods on overcoming challenges in a project from resources, budget, goals, stakeholder support, and people involved in the team. 

- Create a dialogue scenario that discusses a conflict between departments and possible ways of solving them. 
- Discuss the methods of negotiation that will be utilized to try and find a common ground between the stakeholders.
- Showcase expert commentary along with industry-standard research and discussion from the text for how you would appropriately resolve the conflict to keep the project moving forward.
 

Your paper should be 1-2 pages in length and conform to the CSU Global Writing Center (which can be accessed by selecting the button in the left-hand Canvas navigation panel). Include at least two credible references in addition to the course textbook.

Module 3: Portfolio Milestone - Initial Project Codebase PMP

Project Plan: Environment Variables, Scope Processes, and Organizational Systems - Paper Build a project management plan for your Portfolio Project. This will be iterative and you will add to this throughout the rest of the course.

For this first part begin to integrate environment variables, scope processes, and organizational systems into as a project plan. You can use Excel or Lucid Chart for your initial project plan design.

If you use Lucid Chart please refer to Get Started with Lucid chartLinks to an external site. for instructions on how to use the tool and how to download the diagram.

Submit your project plan along with a one-page paper discussing the initial WBS for your project and how that will work in your overall process

Title: Critical Thinking Module 2: A Project Management Plan for Refreshing Network and Laptop Equipment

---
---

Assignment Description:   
The Unhappy Stakeholder  
You have recently been placed in charge of refreshing the network and laptop equipment for your organization. The organization consists of 150 different employees who are located in each of the 48 states inside the continental United States. Some states have multiple facilities, and most states are along the northern and southern borders of the United States. You are responsible for upgrading a fleet of laptop systems as well as a router and 2-3 switches per site.

The object of this exercise is not for you to have a definitive understanding of what all these pieces of hardware deal with. The objective is for you to showcase a project management plan as well as research reasons why you might utilize one hardware over another.

Think about costs, phases, and interdependencies between tasks. While this is not expected to be a complete development plan with a Gantt chart, it should discuss some of the processes that would be associated with implementation of the plan and showcase a sample of the phases of carrying out the plan. Discuss what will be delivered and how it will be delivered. This should include possible risks associated with the delivery in the field and on-site smart hands.

Your paper should be 1-2 pages in length and conform to the CSU Global Writing Center (which can be accessed by selecting the button in the left-hand Canvas navigation panel). Include at least two credible references in addition to the course textbook. The CSU Global Library (which can be accessed by selecting the button in the left-hand Canvas navigation panel) is a good place to find these references.

Engagement Level Diagram  
Utilize Lucidchart (Links to an external site.) to draw out an engagement level diagram for the core stakeholders in your chosen company from Portfolio Milestone 1. You should create a Stakeholder Engagement Assessment Matrix (Page 45 of uCertify textbook) and then draw up a quick use case study on each of the five engagement levels and why a particular person is in that engagement level.

Review the Get Started with Lucidchart article for information on how to access and use this tool.

Download your chart from Lucidchart as a PDF or a JPEG as explained in the guide and submit it by the posted due date.
