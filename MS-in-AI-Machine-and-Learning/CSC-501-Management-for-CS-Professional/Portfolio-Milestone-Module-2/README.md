Module 2: Portfolio Milestone

Engagement Level Diagram  
Utilize Lucidchart (Links to an external site.) to draw out an engagement level diagram for the core stakeholders in your chosen company from Portfolio Milestone 1. You should create a Stakeholder Engagement Assessment Matrix (Page 45 of uCertify textbook) and then draw up a quick use case study on each of the five engagement levels and why a particular person is in that engagement level.

Review the Get Started with Lucidchart article for information on how to access and use this tool.

Download your chart from Lucidchart as a PDF or a JPEG as explained in the guide and submit it by the posted due date.

My project:  
For my CSC501 portfolio project, I chose a project management approach to develop and implement a software system called Project Codebase, a personal project. However, to meet the CSC501 portfolio project requirements, I have reframed the Project Codebase project as a fictional internal system being developed by a company called Omega.py (I own the omegapy.com domain). The goal of the project is to manage the development and implementation of an intelligent platform/AI agent that would assist Omega.py software engineers and AI coding agents in understanding existing and being developed software codebases and architectures.

A key component of a project's success is stakeholder engagement. The Stakeholder Engagement Assessment report provides a Stakeholder Engagement Assessment Matrix for the Omega.py Project Codebase, along with a quick use case study detailing current and desired engagement levels, and strategies to transition stakeholders to their desired engagement level.
