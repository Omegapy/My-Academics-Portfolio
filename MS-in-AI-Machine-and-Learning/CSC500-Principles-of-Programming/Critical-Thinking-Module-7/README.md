Principles of Programming CSC500 – Python Programming   
Professor: Brian Holbert  
Fall C (25FC) – 2025   
Student: Alexander (Alex) Ricciardi

**Program Description:**

The program is a small terminal app that allows a user to view 
an ‘university’ course(s) information (course number, room, instructor, and time) 
by entering a course number. 
The course information (data) is stored in three dictionaries, 
and the course numbers are used as keys within the dictionaries.

**Assignment Directions:**  

**Creating Python Programs**

Write a program that creates a dictionary containing course numbers and the room numbers of the rooms where the courses meet. The dictionary should have the following key–value pairs:

**Key–Value Pairs: Room Number**

| Course Number (key) | Room Number (value) |
|---|---|
| CSC101 | 3004 |
| CSC102 | 4501 |
| CSC103 | 6755 |
| NET110 | 1244 |
| COM241 | 1411 |

The program should also create a dictionary containing course numbers and the names of the instructors that teach each course. The dictionary should have the following key–value pairs:

**Key–Value Pairs: Instructors**

| Course Number (key) | Instructor (value) |
|---|---|
| CSC101 | Haynes |
| CSC102 | Alvarado |
| CSC103 | Rich |
| NET110 | Burke |
| COM241 | Lee |

The program should also create a dictionary containing course numbers and the meeting times of each course. The dictionary should have the following key–value pairs:

**Key–Value Pairs: Meeting Time**

| Course Number (key) | Meeting Time (value) |
|---|---|
| CSC101 | 8:00 a.m. |
| CSC102 | 9:00 a.m. |
| CSC103 | 10:00 a.m. |
| NET110 | 11:00 a.m. |
| COM241 | 1:00 p.m. |

**Program Behavior:**  
The program should let the user enter a course number and then display the course’s room number, instructor, and meeting time.

**Submission**

Compile and submit a single document containing all of the following:
- Source code
- Screenshots of the application executing the code and the results
- Link to your Git repository

---

**Project Map:**

- Project Report.pdf - Contains the source code, the program outputs, and Git repository  screenshots.
- course_info.py - Contains the main function and the program logic for the assignment.
- validation_utilities.py - Contains user input prompt and validation functions.
- menu_banner_utilities.py - Contains ASCII banner and menu UI classes.
