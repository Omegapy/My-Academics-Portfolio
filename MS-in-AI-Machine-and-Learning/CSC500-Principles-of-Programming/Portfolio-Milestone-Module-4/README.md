**Program Description:**

The program is a small terminal app. It is an implementation of an online shopping cart.  
The program renders banners and a menu, and it calculates the total cost of items based on each item's price and quantity.   
Only two items are asked to be entered in this implementation.

**Assignment Directions:**  

Online Shopping Cart  
Step 1: Build the ItemToPurchase class with the following specifications:  
- Attributes
- item_name (string)
- item_price (float)
- item_quantity (int)
- Default constructor

Initializes item's name = "none", item's price = 0, item's quantity = 0  
Method  
print_item_cost()  
Example of print_item_cost() output:  
Bottled Water 10 @ $1 = $10  

Step 2: In the main section of your code, prompt the user for two items and create two objects of the ItemToPurchase class.  
Example:  
Item 1  
Enter the item name:  
Chocolate Chips  
Enter the item price:  
3  
Enter the item quantity:  
1  
Item 2  
Enter the item name:  
Bottled Water  
Enter the item price:  
1  
Enter the item quantity:  
10  

Step 3: Add the costs of the two items together and output the total cost.  
Example:  
TOTAL COST  
Chocolate Chips 1 @ $3 = $3  
Bottled Water 10 @ $1 = $10  
Total: $13  

Your program submission materials must include your source code and screenshots of the application executing the code and the results. Please refer to the video as a recourse and reference: Python Classes and Objects (With Examples).
