## Critical Thinking Module 5
Directory: [Critical-Thinking-Module 5](https://github.com/Omegapy/My-Academics-Portfolio/tree/main/MS-in-AI-Machine-and-Learning/CSC500-Principles-of-Programming/Critical-Thinking-Module-5)   
Title: Critical Thinking Module 5 – Rainfall Average Calculator and Bookstore Points

---
---

Assignment Description:  

Creating Python Programs

Part 1:  
Write a program that uses nested loops to collect data and calculate the average rainfall over a period of years. The program should first ask for the number of years. The outer loop will iterate once for each year. The inner loop will iterate twelve times, once for each month. Each iteration of the inner loop will ask the user for the inches of rainfall for that month. After all iterations, the program should display the number of months, the total inches of rainfall, and the average rainfall per month for the entire period.

Part 2:  
The CSU Global Bookstore has a book club that awards points to its students based on the number of books purchased each month. The points are awarded as follows:  
•	If a customer purchases 0 books, they earn 0 points.  
•	If a customer purchases 2 books, they earn 5 points.  
•	If a customer purchases 4 books, they earn 15 points.  
•	If a customer purchases 6 books, they earn 30 points.  
•	If a customer purchases 8 or more books, they earn 60 points.  
Write a program that asks the user to enter the number of books that they have purchased this month and then displays the number of points awarded.

Submission:  
Compile and submit your pseudocode, source code, and screenshots of the application executing the code from Parts 1 and 2, the results and GIT repository in a single document (Word is preferred).

---

Program Description:

The program is a small console-based program consisting of 2 parts.

-	Part 1 - Rainfall Average Calculator captures rainfall data from user inputs and calculates the rainfall average from the inputted per-month rainfall for the inputted number of years. Then display the results in the console.
-	Part 2 - Bookstore Points calculates the Bookstore club points based on a tier system from the user inputted number of books purchased and displays the results.

Directory: [Portfolio-Milestone-Module-4](https://github.com/Omegapy/My-Academics-Portfolio/tree/main/MS-in-AI-Machine-and-Learning/CSC500-Principles-of-Programming/Portfolio-Milestone-Module-4)   
Title: Portfolio Milestone Module 4 – Online Shopping Cart

---
---

Assignment Description:  

Online Shopping Cart  
Step 1: Build the ItemToPurchase class with the following specifications:  
- Attributes
- item_name (string)
- item_price (float)
- item_quantity (int)
- Default constructor

Initializes item's name = "none", item's price = 0, item's quantity = 0  
Method  
print_item_cost()  
Example of print_item_cost() output:  
Bottled Water 10 @ $1 = $10  

Step 2: In the main section of your code, prompt the user for two items and create two objects of the ItemToPurchase class.  
Example:  
Item 1  
Enter the item name:  
Chocolate Chips  
Enter the item price:  
3  
Enter the item quantity:  
1  
Item 2  
Enter the item name:  
Bottled Water  
Enter the item price:  
1  
Enter the item quantity:  
10  

Step 3: Add the costs of the two items together and output the total cost.  
Example:  
TOTAL COST  
Chocolate Chips 1 @ $3 = $3  
Bottled Water 10 @ $1 = $10  
Total: $13  

Your program submission materials must include your source code and screenshots of the application executing the code and the results. Please refer to the video as a recourse and reference: Python Classes and Objects (With Examples)..

---

Program Description:

The program is a small terminal app. It is an implementation of an online shopping cart.  
The program renders banners and a menu, and it calculates the total cost of items based on each item's price and quantity.  
Only two items are asked to be entered in this implementation.

## Critical Thinking Module 3
Directory: [Critical-Thinking-Module 3](https://github.com/Omegapy/My-Academics-Portfolio/tree/main/MS-in-AI-Machine-and-Learning/CSC500-Principles-of-Programming/Critical-Thinking-Module-3)   
Title: Critical Thinking Assignment Module 3 – Meal Bill Calculator & Alarm Clock

---
---

Assignment Description:  

Creating Python Programs   
Part 1:  
Write a program that calculates the total amount of a meal purchased at a restaurant. The program should ask the user to enter the charge for the food and then calculate the amounts with an 18 percent tip and 7 percent sales tax. Display each of these amounts and the total price.

Part 2:  
Many people keep time using a 24-hour clock (11 is 11am and 23 is 11pm, 0 is midnight). If it is currently 13 and you set your alarm to go off in 50 hours, it will be 15 (3pm). Write a Python program to solve the general version of the above problem. Ask the user for the time now (in hours) and then ask for the number of hours to wait for the alarm. Your program should output what the time will be on a 24-hour clock when the alarm goes off.

Submission:  
Compile and submit your pseudocode, source code, and screenshots of the application executing the code from Parts 1 and 2, the results and GIT repository in a single document (Word is preferred).

---

Program Description:

The program is a small terminal app. that has two parts:
- Part 1 (Restaurant Bill): Total meal calculator based on food charges/tips/taxes
- Part 2 (24-Hour Alarm): Alarm time calculator based on military time (24hours)  and (added functionality) labels the day the alarm will go off (Today, Tomorrow, or In N days).  
It also includes input validation.

Title: Critical Thinking Assignment 1 – Basic Calculator

---
---

Assignment Description:  

Creating Python Programs  
Part 1:  
Write a Python program to find the addition and subtraction of two numbers.

Ask the user to input two numbers (num1 and num2). Given those two numbers, add them together to find the output. Also, subtract the two numbers to find the output.

Part 2:  
Write a Python program to find the multiplication and division of two numbers.

Ask the user to input two numbers (num1 and num2). Given those two numbers, multiply them together to find the output. Also, divide num1/num2 to find the output.

Compile and submit your pseudocode, source code, and screenshots of the application executing the code from parts 1 and 2, the results and GIT repository in a single document (Word is preferred).

Note: Refer to the Module 1 Overview for resources and help using GIT

---

Program Description:

The program is a basic calculator for addition/subtraction, multiplication/division.  
Part 1: addition/subtraction 
Part 2: multiplication/division.
