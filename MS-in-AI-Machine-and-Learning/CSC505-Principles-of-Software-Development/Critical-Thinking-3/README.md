**Program Description:**

Part of Step 3: Python Script to Describe Prototype.  
The program is a small console program that summarizes a mobile shopping app UI flow.  
The script lists screens, counts, descriptions, and navigation screen UI flow paths.

**Assignment Directions:**  

You’ve been approached to create an initial prototype for a mobile app that allows users to manage shopping lists on their personal devices. Your task is to create a preliminary architectural design, paper prototype sketches, and a Python summary script that outlines the structure and flow of your design.  
This assignment focuses on the early stages of mobile app development, including UX planning, system architecture, and process flow.  

**Step 1**: Architectural Design Diagram  
Begin by creating a preliminary architecture for your mobile app. Use a diagramming tool (UML or otherwise) to represent key components and interactions. 

Your design should include:  
User interface layer (e.g., Home, Add Item, Edit List, View List, Settings)  
Data layer (e.g., local storage or lightweight cloud sync)  
Controller or logic layer (handles list management, sorting, item removal, etc.)  
Optional extensions (e.g., reminder notifications, sharing lists)  

Recommended Diagram Types:    
UML Component Diagram   
UML Class Diagram   
UML Activity Diagram (to show app behavior)   

Use one of the following tools to create your diagram:  
UMLetLinks to an external site.  
GliffyLinks to an external site.  
Microsoft Visio (if available)  
Export your diagram as .png or .pdf.  

**Step 2**: Paper Prototype Screens  
Sketch a paper prototype of your mobile app showing key screens (hand-drawn or digitally   sketched). 

At a minimum, include:  
Home screen  
Add Item screen  
View List screen  
Edit/Delete Items screen  
Settings/About screen  

Label each screen clearly and show navigation flow between screens (e.g., arrows or numbered steps).  

You may use tools like:    
Pen and paper + phone photo  
Figma (free design tool)  
PowerPoint / Google Slides mockups  
Gliffy / Visio UI stencils  

Tip: The goal is not high-fidelity design, but to simulate how a user would move through the app and what they’d see.

**Step 3**: Python Script to Describe Prototype  

Create a Python script (shopping_list_prototype.py) that:  
Defines the screen names  
Prints the total number of screens  
Prints the navigation flow (e.g., "Home → Add Item → Save → View List")  
Optionally includes descriptions of what each screen does  
Sample Output:

Screens: Home, Add Item, View List, Edit Item, Settings  
Total Screens: 5  
Flow:  
Home → Add Item  
Add Item → View List  
View List → Edit Item  
Home → Settings  

Keep the code simple and use lists or dictionaries to model screens and navigation.

**Step 4**: Submit Your Work  
Submit a zipped folder containing:

Your Python script (shopping_list_prototype.py)  
A screenshot of the script running successfully  
Your architecture diagram (.png or .pdf)  
Your paper prototype screens (images or .pdf)  
(Optional) README.txt with additional notes or assumptions

**Articles and tutorials used**
 
- Apple's "Human Interface Guidelines" tutorial (Apple, n.d.) was used as a reference on how to design UI layout for mobile apps. 
- The "Mobile user experience: Limitations and strengths" (Budiu, 2015) was used as a reference on how to create UI prototypes that follow standard mobile usability guidelines.
- The "UML Component Diagrams" tutorial (UML Diagrams, n.d.) was used as a reference on how to properly draw a UML component diagram.
- The IBM Carbone (IBM, n.d.), an open source design system project, more specifically the "Partner" section, was used as a reference on how to design the "empty state" of the shopping list (when no items are added yet) and the search functionality of the app.
- The course textbook, more specifically "Chapter 4: Recommended Process Model" (Pressman & Maxim, 2020), was used as a reference on how to construct and evaluate a prototype.
