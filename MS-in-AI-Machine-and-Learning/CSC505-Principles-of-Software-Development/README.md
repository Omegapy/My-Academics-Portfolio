Title: Critical Thinking Assignment 2 – Development and Design Model

---
---

Assignment Description:  

Consider the traditional Waterfall Model, which includes sequential stages: communication, planning, modeling, construction, and deployment (Adapted from Pressman, 2020, p. 26). While foundational, this model has limitations in today's fast-changing software environments.  
<img width="850" height="229" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37c00a7e-06bc-4fb9-95d8-b38e9ce41b61" />  
The Waterfall Model includes: Communication (project initiation, requirement gathering), planning (estimating, scheduling, tracking), modeling (analysis, design), construction (code, test, peer validation), and deployment (delivery, support, feedback, TAM).  
(Adapted from Pressman, 2020, p. 26)


For this assignment, you will evaluate the Waterfall Model’s shortcomings and design a modernized version called the YourLastName Adaptive Model. You will visualize it with a UML-style diagram and simulate user interaction using a Python script.

**Instructions:**

Evaluate the Waterfall Model:  
- Briefly identify at least three limitations of the traditional Waterfall Model (e.g., lack of flexibility, late testing, poor adaptability to change).

Design the YourLastName Adaptive Model:
- Using your findings, design a modernized process model. You may integrate principles from Agile, DevOps, or Spiral methodologies.   
Your model should still include major phases, but with added adaptability or feedback loops.

Create a UML Diagram:  
Create a visual diagram of your model using one of the following tools
- UMLetLinks to an external site.
- GliffyLinks to an external site.
- Microsoft Visio (optional, if already available)
Export your diagram as a .png or .pdf.

Develop a Python Script:  
Implement a script named yourlastname_model.py that:  
- Prompts the user for each phase name and a short description.
- Outputs a well-formatted summary of the model’s phases and structure.

Example output:
Phase 1: Discovery - Understand user needs and priorities  
Phase 2: Iterative Design - Develop, test, and refine features  

Gather Your Submission:  
Submit the following in a zipped folder:
- Python source file (.py)
- Screenshot of successful program execution
- UML diagram (.png or .pdf)   

---

Program Description:  
The program is part of the Develop a Python Script section of the assignment, it is a console program that:  
    1. Prompts users for how many phases their model has  
    2. Prompts users for the name and a short description of each phase in their model  
    3. Prints a well formatted summary:  

    Phase 1: Discovery - Understand user needs and priorities
    Phase 2: Iterative Design - Develop, test, and refine features

## Critical Thinking 1

Title: Critical Thinking Assignment 1 – Sales Analysis

---
---

Assignment Description:  

For this assignment, you will write a simple Python prototype and then create a short developer report, simulating the kind of deliverable expected by a technical team lead or project manager in a modern software development environment. Whether you’re working independently or as part of a team, understanding the challenges of software development and communicating technical work clearly are essential skills for success.  

To get familiar with Python programming and integrated development tools used in the field, begin by writing a Python script with a practical, real-world purpose. Then, create a brief developer-facing report reflecting on key aspects of your experience and how they relate to broader software development challenges.  


Part 1: Python Script Development  
Write a Python script that performs a useful or realistic task. You may choose one of the following or propose your own idea:  

A command-line tip calculator.  
A script that reads and analyzes a CSV file (e.g., grades, sales).  
A simple to-do list or task tracker.  
A basic simulation (e.g., mock CPU/memory monitor using random values).  
A log parser that searches for keywords in a sample file.  
Use any modern IDE of your choice (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm, Replit).  


Part 2: Developer Report (Professional Documentation)  
After completing your script, prepare a developer report answering the following   stakeholder-facing questions based on your experience:  

What was the purpose or intended use case of your script?  
What tools or libraries did you use, and why?  
What challenges did you encounter during development?  
How would you expand or improve this prototype in future iterations?  
What lessons did you learn that apply to broader software development work?  
Keep your responses brief and professional (1–3 sentences per question). This report simulates what you might send as part of an internal project handoff or sprint demo.   


Part 3: Submission Requirements  
Submit the following in a zipped folder:  

Your Python source file (.py).  
A screenshot of your program running successfully.  
Your completed developer report (.txt, .md, or .pdf).
