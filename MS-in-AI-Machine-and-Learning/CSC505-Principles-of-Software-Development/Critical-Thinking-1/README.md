**Assignment Directions:**  

For this assignment, you will write a simple Python prototype and then create a short developer report, simulating the kind of deliverable expected by a technical team lead or project manager in a modern software development environment. Whether you’re working independently or as part of a team, understanding the challenges of software development and communicating technical work clearly are essential skills for success.  

To get familiar with Python programming and integrated development tools used in the field, begin by writing a Python script with a practical, real-world purpose. Then, create a brief developer-facing report reflecting on key aspects of your experience and how they relate to broader software development challenges.  


Part 1: Python Script Development  
Write a Python script that performs a useful or realistic task. You may choose one of the following or propose your own idea:  

A command-line tip calculator.  
A script that reads and analyzes a CSV file (e.g., grades, sales).  
A simple to-do list or task tracker.  
A basic simulation (e.g., mock CPU/memory monitor using random values).  
A log parser that searches for keywords in a sample file.  
Use any modern IDE of your choice (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm, Replit).  


Part 2: Developer Report (Professional Documentation)  
After completing your script, prepare a developer report answering the following   stakeholder-facing questions based on your experience:  

What was the purpose or intended use case of your script?  
What tools or libraries did you use, and why?  
What challenges did you encounter during development?  
How would you expand or improve this prototype in future iterations?  
What lessons did you learn that apply to broader software development work?  
Keep your responses brief and professional (1–3 sentences per question). This report simulates what you might send as part of an internal project handoff or sprint demo.   


Part 3: Submission Requirements  
Submit the following in a zipped folder:  

Your Python source file (.py).  
A screenshot of your program running successfully.  
Your completed developer report (.txt, .md, or .pdf).
