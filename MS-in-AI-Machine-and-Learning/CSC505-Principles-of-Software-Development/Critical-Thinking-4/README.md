**Program Description:**

Write a Python Script: developer_builder.py    
The program is a small python script that runs in the console program.  
It creates Developer objects listing desire developer personality traits (Resilience, Awareness Pragmatism).

**Assignment Directions:**  

For this assignment, you will identify three personality traits commonly found in high-performing developers based on your professional experience or observations. You will then represent these traits using a UML diagram and simulate their construction in a Python program using the Builder Design Pattern for inspiration.

**Instructions:**

**Identify Developer Traits:**  
- Choose three personality traits that you believe are essential for modern software developers.  
- These can include traits such as curiosity, adaptability, empathy, persistence, communication, or collaboration. Write a brief explanation of each trait and why it's important for team-based software development.   

**Create a UML Diagram:**  
- Model these traits using a UML class diagram, applying the structure of the Builder Design Pattern as shown on OODesign.com. Your UML diagram should:
    - Include a Developer class with each trait as an attribute
    - Include a Developer Builder (or similar) class that constructs the developer object
    - Clearly show class relationships (e.g., composition, method calls)
    - Use one of the following UML tools to create the diagram:
        - UMLetLinks to an external site.
        - GliffyLinks to an external site.
        - Microsoft Visio (optional, if already available)
**Export your diagram as a .png or .pdf file.**  
**Write a Python Script:**
- Develop a Python program (developer_builder.py) that:
    - Defines a Developer class with attributes for each selected trait
    - Uses a builder or fluent interface to construct the developer object
    - Prints a formatted output including:
        - The trait names
        - A brief description of each trait
        - The number of traits represented
Example output:  
Building your ideal developer...
Trait: Curiosity – Drives exploration of new tools and techniques
Trait: Empathy – Enhances team communication and user understanding
Trait: Adaptability – Enables flexibility in changing environments
Total traits included: 3

**Prepare Your Submission:**  
Submit the following in a zipped folder:   
Your Python script file (developer_builder.py)  
A screenshot of the script running successfully  
Your UML diagram (as .png or .pdf)
