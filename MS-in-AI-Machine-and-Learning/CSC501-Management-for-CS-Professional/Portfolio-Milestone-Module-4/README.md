Module 4: Portfolio Milestone - Project Design and Outline  
Submit your project plan with budget, resources, and stakeholder analysis. By now, you should have a viable project plan for your portfolio project. You can include diagrams, charts, and a rough outline for your project, including the project scope and timeline estimates for inception, delivery, and maintenance. You should also discuss possible change requests and goal alignments.

My project:  
For my CSC501 portfolio project, I chose a project management approach to develop and implement a software system called Project Codebase, a personal project. However, to meet the CSC501 portfolio project requirements, I have reframed the Project Codebase project as a fictional internal system being developed by a company called Omega.py (I own the omegapy.com domain). The goal of the project is to manage the development and implementation of an intelligent platform/AI agent that would assist Omega.py software engineers and AI coding agents in understanding existing and being developed software codebases and architectures.

A key component of a project's success is stakeholder engagement. The Stakeholder Engagement Assessment report provides a Stakeholder Engagement Assessment Matrix for the Omega.py Project Codebase, along with a quick use case study detailing current and desired engagement levels, and strategies to transition stakeholders to their desired engagement level.
