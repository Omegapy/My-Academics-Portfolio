## Program Description:

The Algorithm Comparison Tool is a web-app that compares linear search O(n) vs. binary search O(log n) algorithms using integer datasets. The tool provides a browser UI that allows the user to build datasets, run searches with step traces, compare both algorithms side by side, benchmark at scale with timing charts. It also provides a Big-O analysis and recommendation guide.

## Assignment:

**Main Project Goal:**
Build the foundation of your portfolio project with comprehensive search and sorting algorithm implementations.

**Selected Option:** Algorithm Comparison Tool

**This Portfolio Milestone:**

Deliverables:
- Source code file with linear search implementation
- Source code file with binary search implementation
- Performance testing results showing execution times for different array sizes
- Written analysis (1-2 pages) explaining Big O notation for both algorithms
- Screenshots showing the tool finding items in different sized datasets
- Recommendation guide explaining when to choose each algorithm

Success Criteria:
- Linear search works correctly on any array
- Binary search works correctly on sorted arrays only
- Timing results clearly show performance differences
- Analysis correctly explains O(n) vs O(log n) complexity
- Tool demonstrates real-world application of search algorithms

**Note:**   
I got permission from the professor to use a video recording to showcase the app functionality instead of screenshots. See `video_demo.mp4` for the video demo.

## Program Requirements:
- Python 3.12+
- `streamlit` (install via `pip install streamlit`)
- `pandas` (install via `pip install pandas`)
- `colorama` (install via `pip install colorama`)

---

## How to Run:

```bash
# If using a Python virtual environment, first activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies (if not already installed)
pip install streamlit pandas colorama

# Launch the Streamlit app (from the repository root)
streamlit run Portfolio-Milestone-Module-2/streamlit_app.py
```

The app opens in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Search and Timing Approaches

This project uses slightly different search/timing approaches depending on the feature being used:

| Feature | Purpose | Search Approach | Timing Approach |
|---------|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Search Playground | Interactive single-search demo | Runs one selected algorithm on the current dataset and shows the full result with step trace | Uses a stable batched timing estimate so very small searches are less affected by microsecond-level noise |
| Compare Algorithms | Side-by-side demonstration | Runs both linear search and binary search on the same sorted dataset for a fair comparison | Uses the same stable batched timing estimate as the Search Playground |
| Benchmark Lab | Performance measurement across dataset sizes | Generates fresh sorted datasets for each size and uses a worst-case missing target to force maximum comparisons | Uses repeated `timeit`-style batched measurements so the timing results are more reliable for analysis |

### Why these approaches are different

- The Search Playground and Compare Algorithms tabs prioritize responsiveness and explanation, so they keep the step trace and show a stable estimate of the search time.
- The Benchmark Lab prioritizes measurement quality, so it disables step-trace overhead and runs repeated batched timing samples to better reflect algorithm scaling.
- Binary search is always performed on sorted data in the app. In the interactive tabs and benchmark, the app uses datasets that are already sorted before the search is run.
