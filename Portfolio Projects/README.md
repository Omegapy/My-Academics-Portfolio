Program Objective:  
To manage a home inventory system with functionality to add, update, remove, and display homes data.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assignment Directions:  
Option #2: Program Corrections, Lessons Learned, and Home Inventory Program  
Create a home inventory class that will be used by a National Builder to maintain an inventory of available houses in the country.    
The following attributes should be present in your home class:  

- private int squarefeet

- remove a home
- update home attributes  
At the end of your program, be sure that it allows the user to output all home inventory to a text file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pseudocode:
1. Import necessary modules (os) to manipulate file  
2. Create banner  
3. Define the HomeInventory

    - Destructor (del): Perform cleanup when the HomeInventory object is destroyed  
    - Getters: Methods to retrieve home data attributes  
    - Setters: Methods to add, remove, and update homes in the inventory  
    - Class Information Methods: Implement str and repr for string representation of the class  
4. Define display functions
    - display_home_data_using_home_id: Display the home data for a specific home using its ID  
    - display_homes: Display a range of homes from the inventory file  
5. Define menu functions   
    - get_valid_input: Prompt the user for input and validate it based on data type  
    - menus: Display the menus to handle user input and to manipulate the home data  
6. Define the main function  
    - Create a HomeInventory object  
    - Display class HomeInventory information  
    - Start the user interface menu  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Program Inputs:
    - User input for adding, updating, and removing homes  
    - User input for displaying home information  
    - User input for navigating the menu options  
    
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Program Inputs: User input for home details, menu choices, and file name.  
Program Outputs: Display of home inventory, updated inventory file, and user prompts.

Portfolio Project (350 Points)
Argumentative Essay
For your Portfolio Project (due in Module 8) you will write an argumentative essay based on a topic in your major field of study.  
You will submit the topic for approval in Module 2, and continue to write and revise until the due date.  
If you critically read the assigned readings and lecture content, enthusiastically participate in the module discussions,  
submit your best work for the Critical Thinking assignments, and thoughtfully reflect on your instructor feedback,  
you will find that the work for your final portfolio project is the natural progression of your work during the course.  
Based on this cumulative approach, it should represent your strongest work.

Requirements  
Your essay must:

Be persuasive. You need to make a clear argument, articulated in your thesis statement, and supported throughout the body of the essay.  
Be directed at a specific audience.  
Have a thesis statement that includes your overall argument and maps out the points you make in the body of the paper.  
Support the thesis with research from credible sources.  
Demonstrate your ability to synthesize and analyze information from multiple sources in order to develop your own insights into the topic.  
Summarize and respond to counterarguments.  
Include proper in-text citations and references citations in APA format.  
Guidance
Length: 3-4 pages, not including the title page or references page, which you are required to include.
Support: 6 or more credible print sources cited in the paper and included on the references page.   
The sources should be from roughly the last five to seven years.  
Voice: Third-person. APA format does allow for limited use of first-person pronouns when describing your work,   
but it is unlikely you will need to use first person in this project.

Essay Summary:  

Title: Portfolio: Solutions for a Business Enterprise-Wide Upgrade  
The portfolio essay presents solutions for a company's enterprise-wide upgrade, focusing on operating systems, mass storage, virtualization,   
and security. The key points are:  
1. Upgrading to a single corporate operating system (Windows 10) for a more uniform environment, improved security, better support, and enhanced compatibility.  
2. Implementing virtualization to optimize cost and hardware resources, improve security and isolation, facilitate software testing, and support legacy applications.  
3. Recommending a Linux-based Network-Attached Storage (NAS) solution for its cost benefits, flexibility, and advanced features compared to a Windows-based NAS.  
4. Implementing strategies to prevent, avoid, and recover from deadlocks while balancing the company's needs and the trade-offs associated with these strategies.  
5. Employing various security measures, such as antivirus/antimalware software, firewalls, intrusion detection   
and prevention systems, patch management, penetration testing, security awareness training, access controls, encryption, and Systems Event Management (SIEM).  
The essay concludes that implementing these suggestions could significantly improve the company's efficiency, security, and competitiveness,   
as well as create opportunities for exploring new business ventures.
