# Portfolio Project
Program Name: Students Manager  

Grade:  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSC372 – Programming-2 Java Course  
Professor: Dr. Vanessa Cooper  
Spring D Semester (24SD) – 2024  
Student: Alejandro (Alex) Ricciardi  
Date: o8/04/2024   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements:  
- Java JDK-21  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Assignment Directions:  
Option #1: Lessons Learned and Final Program  
- Milestones  
Milestone 1 (due at the end of Week 4): Java source code (with corrections as required) for programs created in Modules 1-3.  
Milestone 2 (due at the end of Week 7): Java source code (with corrections as required) for programs created in Modules 5-6.  

- Final Portfolio Project  
In Week 8, the components you must complete for your Portfolio Project are the Lessons Learned Reflection and the Final Program. Carefully review the requirements below.  

- Lessons Learned Reflection  
Write a summary outlining the lessons you have learned in this programming course. Reflect on how these lessons can be applied to effective coding.  
This essay portion of your Portfolio must:   
•	Be 2-3 pages in length (not including the required title and references pages)  
•	Be formatted according to APA guidelines in the CSU Global Writing Center.  
•	Include at least three outside references from the course readings, formatted according to APA requirements.  

- Final Program  
Write a Java program that incorporates a loop that prompts the user for student data. Student data are private fields in a student class including:  
•	String name  
•	String address  
•	double GPA  

Each student object is stored in a linked list.  
After the user completes the data entry, output the contents of the linked list in ascending sorted order by name to a regular text file that can be opened and viewed using a simple plain-text editor such as notepad.  

Validate numeric data for Grade Point Average (GPA).  
Compile your Lessons Learned Reflection, source code, screenshots of the application executing, and results into a single document.  

Format your document in MS Word, according to APA guidelines in the CSU Global Writing Center, particularly in developing your Lessons Learned Reflection. Support your reflection with a minimum of three references, as noted above. Include both a cover page and a reference page with your Portfolio Project.  

⚠️ Program Notes:    
-	I got permission from Dr. Cooper to use the JavaFX library to display the program outputs.  
-	Added my own icon to the window frame – logo.png.  
-	Added search functionality (not an assignment requirement).  
-	Added read file functionality (not an assignment requirement).  
-	Added the option to add fake data to the file for troubleshooting purposes (not an assignment requirement).  
-	Implemented my own selection sort and binary search algorithms.  
-	Created a UML class diagram.  
-	For the source code please see the following: Student.java, StudentManager.java, NameComparator.java, GpaComparator.java, SortSearchUtil.java, StudentManagerApp.java

Program Description:  
The Students Manager is a small Java application that utilizes JavaFX GUI  allowing the user to add, view, search, and sort students data:   
        - Student data management (name, address, GPA)  
        - File-based storage  
        - Sorting by name or GPA  
        - Search functionality  
        - Basic data validation  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
