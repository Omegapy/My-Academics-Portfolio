Portfolio Milestone (125 Points)
For your Portfolio Project you will develop an application in four stages, which will be covered in Modules 2, 4, 6, 8. The project can be of your choice, but here are some project ideas to consider:

Social media aggregator app: Create an app that collects and displays posts from multiple social media platforms.
Fitness tracker app: Develop an app that tracks and analyzes users' fitness activities, including steps, calories, and distance.
Recipe app: Design an app that provides a collection of recipes with search and favorite features.
Language learning app: Build an app that offers vocabulary exercises and quizzes for different languages.
Event planning app: Create an app to help users organize and manage events, including invitations and reminders.
The project should be completed in four parts, following agile methodology:

Requirements Gathering and Analysis (Module 2):  
Deliver a document (2 pages) that outlines the purpose and scope of the app. Identify the target audience and their needs. List the key features and functionalities of the app. Analyze any specific UI/UX requirements.

Program Description:

- This project contains a document that describes the requirements, UI/UX analysis, audience, and scope of an Android recipe app. The app's scope is to provide access to meal recipes to a user through a UI system that includes view, search, add, modify, and favorite recipe functionalities. 
- The app will be developed using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, with plans for future integration of a Large Language Model (LLM) chatbot and the TheMealDB API (n.d.) to access and share recipe data.
